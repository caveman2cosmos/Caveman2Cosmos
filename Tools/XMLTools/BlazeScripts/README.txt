These are a small collection of scripts mostly used to manipulate XML entries
in a (hopefully) faster way than doing so manually. They likely will break as
the formatting of files and stuff changes, but that's OK. Mostly just here so
that if anyone else happens to want to do something similar, they have a base
to build off of rather than starting from entirely scratch (although, most of
these were made in like an afternoon or less, so...)
