## CvAltRoot
##
## Tells Rise of Mankind where to locate its files when it cannot find them normally.
## This is common when using the /AltRoot Civ4 feature or sometimes on
## non-English operating systems and Windows Vista.
##
## HOW TO USE
##
## 1. Change the text in the quotes below to match the full path to the
##    "Beyond the Sword" folder that contains the CivilizationIV.ini file.
##    Make sure to use forward slashes (/), even for Windows paths.
##
##    Windows XP: "C:/Documents and Settings/[UserName]/My Documents/My Games/Beyond the Sword"
##
##    Windows Vista: "C:/Users/[UserName]/Documents/My Games/Beyond the Sword"
##
##    MacOS: "/home/[UserName]/Documents/Beyond the Sword"
##
##
## 2. Copy this file to the "Python" folder.
##    When Rise of Mankind is installed as a mod, the folder is "Assets/Python".
##
##
## Note!
##
## if above method doesn't help, locate the "Beyond the Sword" installation folder. 
## This location is not in the documents folders, instead it's usually in 
## "Program Files" ie. "C:/Program Files/Firaxis/Sid Meier's Civilization 4/Beyond the Sword"
## The folder usually contains "_Civ4config" shortcut (on Windows systems). Once you have
## located this folder, follow the step 2 again. Usually when [username] in above examples
## contains non-english letters you will have to use the installation folder location.
