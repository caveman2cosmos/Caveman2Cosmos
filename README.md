Caveman2Cosmos is a [CivFanatics.com](https://www.civfanatics.com) community mod that add new features, gameplay, and content to the Civilization 4 experience.
It is the most expansive Civilization 4: BTS mod to date with almost daily updates since November 2010.
It is the spiritual successor the The Civilization 4 mod Rise of Mankind and its addon A New Dawn, and combines the work of over 100+ CivFanatics.com
past and present modders to create a mod to "rule them all".  

It is currently being developed by StrategyOnly Productions with a modding team made up of prominent members of [CivFanatics.com](https://www.civfanatics.com).
