<a name="about" id="about"><h2>3. About the mod</h2></a>
<hr>

<h3>The Goal</h3>

<p>This mod is my attempt to enhance Civilization 4 to a whole new level. This completely free "Expansion pack" keeps the basic Beyond the Sword game mechanics but converts them to much more complex system which makes this modpack to feel like it's completely new game.</p> 

<p>Ever since Civilization 1 I've liked this series a lot but during Civ 3 I found mods Double Your Pleasure and bit later Rise and Rule which made the game be so much more fun than before that when finally Civ 4 was released, I felt disappointed as it didn't offer as much as did DYP or RAR. Civ 4 had some new elements like religion and civic system (like in Alpha Centauri) but I wanted more techs, more units, more complexicity so I began working on my own mod. I started by going through most of the popular mods and check what's been done already and then by using those mods loosely as my guide, I created this mod.</p>

<h3>The Concept</h3>

<p>This mod is specifically designed for myself and I continue to make changes to the direction that I feel like is correct and which make me like more this game. Aim of the mod is to be more accurate historically which is why the whole tech tree has been redone and many new techs has been added. New techs meant much more room for new buildings and for new units and adding those was my next step. Once I had added most techs, units and buildings it came clear to me that I need to redo unit categories, promotions and change many unit abilities so that more modern units are really superior to older unit types. Note that now you must consider more carefully what to build in city because the number of different buildings has increased so much and because you are now limited to 4 World Wonders per city. 
I used most of my freetime past three years to make this mod so there are numerous changes compared to original game but I didn't keep record of every little change - you'll have to check Civilopedia entries for all the changes. Players' feedback will help me improve this mod and find the correct balance for everything so please post to Rise of Mankind forums if you notice things in the mod that need some tweaking.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>Because the modpack contains now numerous other mods the feature amount has grown steadily over the years. The first thing you'll notice when you start a new game is that there's new map sizes and new game speeds. Giant and Gigantic map sizes give more room for larger empires and for more players but the downside is that these map sizes require quite a lot from your computer so you should only try these maps if you have high-end computer, preferably with 64bit operating system.</p>

<p>When the game starts you'll notice the next improvement which is the interface changes. In Rise of Mankind the interface is fully customizeable through BUG options which you can access by clicking BUG button on top left of the screen or hitting CTRL+ALT+O. The options have been divided into different pages and if you hover your mouse pointer over any option, you'll see help tips for them. Experiment with the settings and change the game look to your own liking.</p>

<p>In Custom Game menu if you scroll down the options list you'll see that there's several new game options. Most of these options are on by default: Revolutions, Inquisitions, Barbarian Civs, Dynamic Civ Names, Tech Diffusion. Rising Seas and Barbarian World options are off by default.</p>

<h3>Transhuman Era</h3>

<p>Transhuman Era is a new game era between Modern Era and the Future tech. The new era contains many present day and near future techs which give access to the most powerful mech, robot and nanite units and to all kinds of new buildings and wonders. In making the new Transhuman era I used Galactic Civilization and Alpha Centauri games as guides so if you've played those games you'll notices similarities. To keep it bit more realistic, I've gone through dozens of science articles and science websites to look info about near future techs. Many of the new techs are based on real life research and many transhuman era units are based on prototypes that exists today in our world.</p>

<h3>Game length</h3>

<p>I recommend playing this mod on Marathon game speed and on huge map size. I prefer making custom game and use Smartmap mapscript for making good continental maps. Mod has also pre-made huge Earth map scenario with 28 Civilizations which all are on their historical starting locations. If you prefer extra long game you could try out the new Snail game speed which has 3000 turns.</p>

<h3>Translations</h3>

<p>The mod works best on English language setting. Germany, Spanish, French and Italian work as well but translations for those are incomplete. For other languages the translation has just begun but there are other modders who have already translated this modpack to various languages like Polish, Russian, Chinese and Japanese.</p>

<h2>5. Mod settings </h2>
</a>
<hr>

<p>Rise of Mankind modpack has many individual mods included. Few of the major mods are RevolutionDCM and BUG. Because the mods have been made by various modders in www.civfanatics.com, most of mods use different methods to change mod settings:</p>
<p><strong>BUG mod v4.3</strong></p>
<p>- in game press <strong>CTRL+ALT+O</strong> to open up BUG mod option screens. BUG mod saves your settings after you close the option screen so you don't need to change the settings every time you launch the mod. </p>
<p>- If you want to use <strong>Advanced Unit Naming</strong> mod feature from BUG mod, you'll have to edit <strong>Adv Unit Naming.ini </strong>in Rise of Mankind -folder.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Tech Conquest</strong></p>

<p><strong>Revolution</strong></p>
<p>- Can be turned off from Game Options when starting Custom Game (scroll down the option list) </p>
<p>- Some of the settings can be found from <strong>Revolution.ini</strong> in the Rise of Mankind\UserSettings -folder</p>
<p>- More settings in <strong>RevolutionDCM.ini </strong>-file after you've made one game with Revolution components on</p>
<p><strong>Dale's Combat Mod</strong></p>
<p>- in game press  <strong>CTRL+ALT+O</strong> and open RevDCM options page</p>
<p><strong>Influence Driven War</strong></p>
<p>- in game press  <strong>CTRL+ALT+O</strong> and open RevDCM options page</p>
<p><strong>Inquisition</strong></p>

<a name="todo" id="todo"><h2>7. Things to do </h2></a>
<hr>

<p>
- rewrite most Strategy texts for all game objects so that they match current settings<br>
- Add pedia for those objects that are still missing it<br>
- convert Enhanced Tech Conquest component to use BUG mod's xml settings format (requires python changes)<br>
- Add Mercenaries python component<br>
- Add UUs/UBs for Barbarian player?<br>
- Civilization specific flavor unit lists (huge task)<br>
- 1 or 2 new UU units for each civilization<br>
- add translations for Chinese, Finnish, Polish, Russian, Hungary and Japanese<br>
- improve other translations<br>
</p>

<a name="issues" id="issues"><h2>8. Known issues</h2></a>
<hr>

<p>
- on some operating system configurations the user may suffer from 'no interface' -problem. For this problem the mod has file named 'CvAltroot.py' in 'Rise of Mankind' folder. If you are experiencing this problem, open this file to Notepad and follow the instructions there. This should fix the problem.
- Civilization modules for regular BtS might not work correctly with this mod due to civic changes in the mod<br><br>
- unit modules for regular BtS might not work correctly with this mod due to unitcombat type changes in the mod<br><br>
- When playing on huge or bigger maps, in late game you may encounter Memory Allocation Faults (MAFs), these happen due to bug in game engine, not bug in the mod. Best way to avoid them is to get more than 2GB RAM and get a graphics card with at least 512MB video RAM. You can also enable Static Leaderheads module and disable civ specific unit artstyle modules (see RoM Concepts pedia for more info).<br><br>
- Giant or Gigantic map sizes might not work correctly on all mapscripts, I recommend making maps for these sizes with advanced mapscripts like Smartmap<br><br>
- Some mapscripts can not (yet) generate Marsh terrain, these will just generate the basic type terrains (same as in Beyond the Sword)<br><br>
