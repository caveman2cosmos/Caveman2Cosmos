| Notes for the next "breaking of save game compatibility" cycle    |
|###################################################################|
| Rename Tags:														|
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

Several hundred if not few thousand tags with mismatched defined and ingame name.
Example INFOTYPE_XYZ being "abc" in game (INFOTYPE_XYZ would be renamed to INFOTYPE_ABC)

Tag types, that could be renamed to match ingame name:
BUILDING_, UNIT_, PROMOTION_
Renames done: ERA_, CIVICOPTION_, CIVIC_, RELIGION_, TECH_, ROUTE_, SPECIALIST_, BONUS_, IMPROVEMENT_, BUILD_, FEATURE_, MAPCATEGORY_, TERRAIN_


========================
There was Toffer's suggestion to separate religious/cultural techs to RELIGION_/CULTURE_ tag types. Techs like Drama, Petroglyphs, Karma, Polytheism etc.
That is some religious/cultural techs would be in separate tree - Maybe that could fit Ideas project?
========================

CODE CHANGES

Mark up sections of code with the @SAVEBREAK tag to indicate changes that should happen to code:

    // @SAVEBREAK DELETE 8/7/2018
    // Delete this code at the next save break.
    // Legacy for FreeTradeRegionBuilding. We need to write out something here to keep save compatibility, so just write out the free area building one again
    WRAPPER_WRITE_CLASS_ARRAY(wrapper, "CvCity", REMAPPED_CLASS_TYPE_BUILDINGS, GC.getNumBuildingInfos(), m_paiNumFreeAreaBuilding);
    // SAVEBREAK@

    // @SAVEBREAK REPLACE 8/7/2018
    // Update this code at the next save break.
    // We determined that the answer was not what we thought, there could be galactic consequences.
    m_fragileSaveData = 42;
    // REPLACE WITH
    // m_fragileSaveData = "towel";
    // SAVEBREAK@

    // @SAVEBREAK ADD 8/7/2018
    // Add this code at the next save break.
    // WRITE_SAVE_DATA(m_newData);
    // SAVEBREAK@

When it comes times to break the save we need to apply all the changes that are marked like this.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Toffer - Rewrite CIV4PlayerColorInfos.xml and CIV4ColorVals.xml.
Reduce amount of excess colour definitions, many duplicates and unused ones currently.
Would cause issues with old saves without some extra recalc code for civ colours.
