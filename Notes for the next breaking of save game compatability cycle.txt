| Notes for the next "breaking of save game compatibility" cycle    |
|###################################################################|
| Rename Tags:														|
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

Several hundred if not few thousand tags with mismatched defined and ingame name.
Example: If INFOTYPE_FISH has the name "Bird" in game then INFOTYPE_FISH should be renamed to INFOTYPE_BIRD.
Rule: Ignore slight deviations, if the mismatch is confusing rename it.

========================
There was Toffer's suggestion to separate religious/cultural techs to RELIGION_/CULTURE_ tag types. Techs like Drama, Petroglyphs, Karma, Polytheism etc.
That is some religious/cultural techs would be in separate tree - Maybe that could fit Ideas project?
========================

CODE CHANGES

Mark up sections of code with the @SAVEBREAK tag to indicate changes that should happen to code:


When it comes times to break the save we need to apply all the changes that are marked like this.

Review CIV4PlayerColorInfos.xml and CIV4ColorVals.xml. 
Reduce amount of excess colour definitions, many duplicates and unused ones currently.
Would cause issues with old saves without some extra recalc code for civ colours.

Currently we can't tell the exe that the last playable slot is slot 39, because NPC's at slots higher than 40 will then get an empty city bar that never upddates.
I'm thinking we may have to give neadnerthals and higher NPC slots a unique dll/python handled city bar, perhaps not use the city object at all for their cities.
That way we could fix the bug where the exe allows the player to define regular starting players in the NPC slots by telling the exe that slot 39 is the last playable one.
