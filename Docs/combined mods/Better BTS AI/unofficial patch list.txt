Bugs fixed in BBAI which would qualify for a patch:

CvUnitAI::AI_paradrop - bug with valuation of terrain bonuses causing paradrops to avoid bonuses in some circumstances when intention is clearly to encourage landing on bonuses and pillaging

CvUnitAI::AI_settleMove - bug when settler cannot reach a city site in an area (blocked by mountains, other player).  Causes settler to wait infinitely in city instead of loading into transport.

CvTeamAI::AI_doWar - should use bFinancesProLimitedWar for limited war calc instead of max war version

CvPlayerAI::AI_calculateUnitAIViability - Incorrect integer used so function return is meaningless, blocks AI logic for building privateers

CvPlayerAI::AI_isFinancialTrouble, CvCityAI::AI_updateBestBuild, and CvPlayerAI::AI_getMinFoundValue - bug in calculating expenses when AI has negative gold per turn

CvPlayerAI::AI_getTotalFloatingDefendersNeeded - poor decision by AI if it has captured one or two cities on someone else's continent, it will minimally defend its new cities

CvPlayerAI::AI_getStrategyHash - counts destroyers as mobile anti-air

CvPlayerAI::AI_doDiplo - when team is sneak attack ready but hasn't declared war, AI may still demand tribute. If other team accepts, it blocks war declaration for 10 turns but AI doesn't react.

CvPlayerAI::AI_bestPlotEspionage - relevant weights are 0, +- 50, +- 100, so comparison for Agg AI should be < 51 instead of < 50

CvPlayerAI::AI_civicTrade - incorrect interpretation of return of getCivicPercentAnger.  Don't block trade if new option civic is better than old in terms of unhappiness

CvPlayerAI::AI_commerceWeight - Governors don't do smart things when human player sets culture slider to 100%

isPotentialEnemy in CvGameCoreUtils - bug leading to AI launching invasions when unable to declare war, troops eventually get bounced when war is declared

CvGame::addPlayer - Don't invalidate color choice for added civ if it's taken by this player slot

CvCityAI::AI_cityThreat - bug when running crush strategy, wrong int is divided
