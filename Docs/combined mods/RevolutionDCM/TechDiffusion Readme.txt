[B]The goal:[/B]

With this component, civs who fall behind in tech but have lots of friends will receive some free research. 

[B]How it works:[/B]

When a civ falls behind by several techs, they qualify for tech "welfare."  Each turn that they are significantly behind, they will receive some free beakers towards techs they can research.  The amount of free beakers depends on how many civs they know who already have the tech and what there relationships are, although the rate for powerful military techs is lowered since civs try harder to keep them secret.  If a civ is behind by a handful of techs, they will get fractions of a percent of the research per turn.  If they are behind by a dozen or more, the rate increases.  

The diffusion of tech is capped so that civs don't receive techs for free but have to do the final research push themselves.  The cap is low in the early eras, and moves up as the eras go on.  If a civ is very far behind, the cap is ignored to try and keep them somewhat in the game.
