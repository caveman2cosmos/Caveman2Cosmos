2.7 RevolutionDCM standardized into BUG format
	- For all practical purposes merging RevDCM will follow the same process as merging the BUG mod, keep in mind RevDCM has modified source files
	- It is recommended you check out the install script if you intend to merge your mod with RevDCM
	- The UserSettings folder is installed seperately (see install script) so you must take this into account when merging

2.00 RevolutionDCM conversion to WoC
	- Basis of the work just carried over from Johny Smith's prototype RevDCM 1.02 WoC Lite Merge version 0.6
	- Core SDK components (DCM, Super Spies, IDW, Revolutions) left untouched except for some commenting clarifications
	- Bare minimum of assets copied across to effect WoC.

1.71 Returning RevolutionDCM to stock defaults:
	- Backup any ini files you have personally customised.
	- Make sure the numbers of starting civs in CIV4WorldInfo.xml are set to default for the sake of random events
	- Return Domestic Advisor to default by returning the txt files in CustomDomAdv to default
	- Return Revolution Advisor to default by returning the txt files in CustomRevAdv to default
	- Delete all ini's except Revolution.ini and Adv Unit Naming.ini. BUG will regenerate as appropriate.

1.70 Adding event behaviour to a BUG userface element
	- Declare a module level handler for the option in the assets/config/whatever.xml file
	- Write the module level handler for the option in assets/contrib/whatever.py

1.68 Unit Naming "isColor" error
	- Any mod that introduces a new combat type needs to modify BUG:
		- Unit Naming.xml (necessary) for example:
			<!--RevolutionDCM - add new combat types here or get python isColor error-->
				<option id="Combat_SPY" key="CombatSPY"
					type="string" default="DEFAULT"/>
		- BugUnitNameOptionsTab.py (not necessary)
			- in case modifying this, Bug xml text has to be added as well.

1.22 branch notes rev watch screen:
	- Basic Rev variables added to the customisable rev watch advisor including colour behaviours
	- Basic rev watch advisor configuration state saved to disk
	- Process involved in adding a rev watch variable:
		- Add data sources to RevWatchAdvisor.py at the commented sections starting #RevolutionDCM - Data sources
		- Add new data manipulation functions to RevWatchAdvisor.py
		- Add txt keys
		- done!

1.21 branch notes rev watch screen:
	- Revwatch screen fires up and is based on the domestic advisor screen code but has it's own python source file
	- Not sure about whether the screen has to be set as dirty at some point
	- Keyboard handling not implemented
	- No revolution information implemented
	- Much domestic advisor code to be removed
	- The old Revwatch popup code in Revolution.py remains as dormant.

1.01 notes:
	- Steps involved in adding option control to the interface:
	  Define game options in assets/config/RevDCM.xml
	  modify assets/config/init.xml to include RevolutionDCM as a mod and as a tab
	  Add a RevolutionDCM tab class python file in assets/python/bug/tabs/RevDCMOptionsTab.py
	  Add a RevDCM.py to assets/contrib/ that configures RevolutionDCM events
	  This places the onus on the game options XML to initially configure the options which are then recorded to a mod ini file.
	  GlobalDefinesAlt.xml is then no longer a driver of state, but merely a way of transferring state from ini to SDK. That state exists only in memory and is not required to be saved back to xml.
	  This system does not override manual editing of GlobalDefinesAlt.xml states, unless they are defined in the game options xml.
	  Because this system can change game state from save to save, one needs to be sure that no introduced game state can result in a CTD or python error in other game state contexts.

0.961 notes:
	- BUG 3.5 changes the event manager from CVCustomEventManager to BugEventManager. There is no real
	  problem with that except that older code has to be carefully positioned inside the init() function
	  so as not cause load problems. See the BugEventManager.py under ---Revolutions--- to see how this is done.
	- The presentation of the BUG mod in terms of root files is untidy with many ini files in the root. Why?

0.96 notes:
	- Revolution 1.64b contains a new source file in the SDK that has to be included in the makefile
	- CvUnitAI DCM fighter engage code now obseleted by Better BTS AI code
	- CvUnitAI DCM AB: Bombing code now obseleted by Better BTS AI code
	- Tsheep SS espionage spending code in CvPlayerAI obseleted by Better BTS AI code


0.95 notes:
	- Updated both SS and RevDCM to Better BTS AI 0.36
	- Merged in BUG3.0:
		- Copied across all unique BUG assets
		- Did not merge Exotic Foreign Advisor because RevDCM version is better
		- Merged in CvInfoScreen.py changes
		- Merged in CvUtil.py
		- Merged in all XML changes (two files)
		- Merged RevDCM CvMainInterface.py into BUG (simpler) and copied across
		- Modified RevDCM CvCustomEventManager.py imports and init function for BUG
		- Modified RevDCM CvModName.py to include extra functions and properties as per BUG
		- Removed BUG equivalents of CvCustomEventManager.py and CvModName.py
		- Copied contents of Bug Mod directory into RevDCM base directory
		- Copied Bug mod ini file contents into RevolutionDCM.ini

0.93 notes:
	- straight port of Rev 1.63
	- UDCM retained because of known good stability
	- Super Spies added:
		- Download SS 1.23 for BTS 3.17 from the SS forum
		- Remove the SS error "UNITCOMBAT_SPY in info class was incorrect": 
			- Integrate the SS module "Spymod" into the standard XML structure of RevDCM
			- Change SS so that there is no module directory called "SpyMod" any longer

0.92 notes:
	- straight port of Rev 1.62

0.91 notes:

	- UDCM asset files not added to avoid 3.17 incompatibility or not required:
		- CvEventManager.py
		- CIV4WorldInfo.xml
		- CvUtil.py

	- UDCM asset files modified to become 3.17 compatible:
		- civ4unitinfos (change <iAirCombatLimit> to 50)
		- xml/art/civ4artdefinesbuilding monument scale 0.5
		- xml/art/civ4artdefinesunit needs only atomic definition added to the end.
		- xml/building/civ4buildinginfos needs the bombshelter special updated
