[B]How to use[/B]

This component is a tool, you decide when you want to activate it and for how long.  Press [B]Ctrl-Shift-X[/B] to open the AIAutoPlay Chooser window, select a number of turns to auto play and select Full Automation from the drop down menu (or no automation).  There is a new feature to have the AI only move your units.  At the start of your turn, change whatever you want or move a couple units, then press [B]Ctrl-Shift-M[/B] to have the AI do the rest of that turn.  You can also cancel automation by pressing [B]Ctrl-Shift-X[/B] again, but only when there are no popups open.  To help with that, there is a config option to block some standard game popups.  

In addition, there is a config option that will fortify all units fortified by the AI at the end of automation.  Without this all units start active, although refortified units will not lose their defense percentage.

[B]Potential uses[/B]

Great for debugging or watching the behavior of the AI, as it shows you only what the AI can see.  Also, if you want to skip certain sections of the game, or you're so close to winning but not quite there, let the AI play it for you!  With many civs in the late game, auto play will still take a while but you won't have to do anything ... it will basically take (# of turns)*(in between turn lag + a little bit) to go through the turns.
