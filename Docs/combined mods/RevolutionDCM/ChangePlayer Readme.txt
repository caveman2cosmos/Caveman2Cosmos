[B]How to use[/B]

This component is a tool, you decide when you want to activate it using two keyboard commands.  Press [B]Ctrl-Shift-L[/B] to open a popup allowing you to select which player you want to control.  This works quite well and is stable.  Press [B]Ctrl-Shift-P[/B] to instead select a player and change their civ, leader or team.  The leader and civ type do not have to correspond.  This is not fully functional as of this writing, with the main issue being that existing unit flags do not update when you change a living player's civ type.  Changing leader heads does appear to work without issue, and the traits will change aswell.

[B]Potential uses[/B]

Using this, you can take control of any other player in the game.  One possibility would be to build up a fantastic empire for ~250 turns, then switch to controlling a rival and see if you can take down your own creation!  Or, if you take control of a rebellion for fun, but then decide you want to go back to your old empire.  You can enable this component in the middle of a game, but you'll probably need to quit and reload to see the change.  The popup for changing a player's civ type or leader is mainly meant to demonstrate the possiblities of the SDK changes.  However, if you want to see how things would be different if Bismark took over for Fredrick, or have always wanted to have Sid control the American Empire, these things are now possible.

[B]Known Issues[/B]

Existing unit flags do not update when you change a living player's civ type.  Putting a player on a new team may result in them losing contact with other players they have met, but their new team has not.
