Ethnically Diverse Units MOD v3.0 Beyond the Sword Edition

DESCRIPTION

This is the Beyond the Sword version of the Ethnically Diverse Units MOD (hence forth referred to as EDU BTS). If you're not familiar with the Ethnically Diverse Units MOD you can read a more detailed desription in the original thread. The only thing I will mention here is that - this mod does not in any way modify the gameplay, it is strictly a graphical modification.

As you may already be aware, the BTS expansion includes many ethnic units. However the units that appear in the game are only part of all the units that were made. All the units however are included on the CD, in other words, think of them as the lost units from vanilla - the resources are there but are not being used. This mod adds those units, 29 in total, to the game as well as a few more things.

All the ethnic units, other than those taken from Warlords scenarios and the BTS Charlemagne scenario, have been made by the EDU team, with guidance from the talented artists at Firaxis. 

There are more than 50 new ethnic units, and altogether, with those taken from Warlords and Charlemagne, and some default/vanilla ones, they cover 16 units across 5 styles - European, Greco-Roman, Middle-Eastern, Asian and South American (aka Native).
The units that have ethnic styles are - Settler, Worker, Warrior, Scout, Archer, Spearman, Chariot, Horse Archer, Axeman, Swordsman, Longbowman, Crossbowman, Pikeman, Maceman, Knight and War Elephant.

In addition to the ethnic units, this mod also includes scale adjustments of naval units based on Elhoim's Better Ship Scale mod, plus minor scale adjustments to other units. As well as more interesting Settlers' "formations" with bigger families.
