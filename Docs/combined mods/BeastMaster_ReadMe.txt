This unit model uses the warlord animation set with a modified command animation, doing a whiplash now. This way, this unit can be used as a "general" for tamed animal units.

The contend of the download can be run as a mod which consist of a set of tamed animal units (using the normal animal graphics) and a simple modification of the CvEventManager.py that automatically adds the Beastmaster unit as a general to the each tamed animal unit that is created. The Beastmaster itself cannot be built. The changes are marked with "Beastmaster - saibotlieh".

The mod further contains a changed unit whip sound as well as a modified "AS3D_UN_WHIP" entry in the Audio3DScripts.py to make the noise louder.
