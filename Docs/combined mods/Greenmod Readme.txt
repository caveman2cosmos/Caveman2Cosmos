GreenMod 2.x by Master Lexx

To install the mod, simply copy the GreenMod 1.x folder
into the Mods folder of your Civ4 gamedirectory.
That´s usually C:\My Program Files\Sid Meiers Civilization 4\Mods\
Then load it in game from advanced -> mods


Also see _Civ4Config for automatic loading this mod:
[CONFIG]
; Specify a Mod folder (Mods\Mesopotamia), '0' for none
;Mod = 0
Mod = Mods\GreenMod 1.x


Look up the directoy structure in my mod until you find /Assets/.
This is invalid: \Civilization 4\Mods\GreenMod20\GreenMod 2.00\Assets
This is valid: \Civilization 4\Mods\GreenMod 2.00\Assets
If you installed my mod correctly it will display "GreenMod 2.00" in the top right in the game. If it displays "Greenmod20" you installed it wrong!
The only thing to note then is, to start the game, options - advanced - choose GreenMod 2.00 - press load. Or configure your Civilization4.ini for autoload of this mod.


If you get the missing text bug, simply delete this file:
Civ4\Mods\GreenMod\Assets\Python\Screens\CvMainInterface.py
But you will lose the advanced turn timer this way.
Also you will have max 6 specialits shown in city screen again.
