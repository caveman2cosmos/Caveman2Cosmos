These maps contain all the space areas that are necessary for the full late game experience of Caveman2Cosmos (only versions after April 1st 2020 (SVN 11143 or later)). They are based on KaTiON's space maps (they contain the only slightly changed space areas of these maps) combined with a starting earthlike world that was randomly created by Toffer90's "World" map script. A few missing resources were added manually.

The Spacemaps can be used just like any other map in Caveman2Cosmos. You can just play with them and if you finish or quit before space comes into play you won´t see any difference to a normal game. Playing on a Spacemap just means that you have the opportunity to use all the space-related stuff in the late game which you don´t have if you start playing on a normal map.

Installation:
Unzip this file and copy one or more of the included map files to ...\Sid Meier's Civilization 4\Beyond the Sword\Mods\Caveman2Cosmos\PrivateMaps. Start Caveman2Cosmos - Single Game - Custom Scenario where you can select your civilization, your name, difficulty, game speed, game settings and victory conditions.
Important: Never use more than the recommended number of civs (yours included)! Additional civs will land in weird places.

Modmods:
I strongly suggest using raxo2222's modmods with these maps which can be found here:
https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/rescaled-latitude-limits-modmod-no-latitude-longitude-limits-modmod.630873/
Only then all lattitude relying buildings can be constructed and only then all animals can appear. Only for the large size maps use "Rescaled Latitude Limits for Large Solar System map" which I recommend. For the duel maps use "No Longitude and Latitude Limits" (removes all lattitude and longitude restrictions and therefore can be used for all space maps).

Map descriptions (In general I recommend using the maps with higher numbers as they are newer and include the improved "World" mapsript from Toffer90):
