## PlayerUtil
##
## Utilities for dealing with Players and their Teams, Cities and Units.
##
## All functions in thie module that take a playerOrID or teamOrID as their
## parameter will accept either the CyPlayer/CyTeam object or its ID.
## Many of them will probably also accept a PyPlayer/PyTeam wrapper, but I
## recommend that you use getCy() on the object instead.
##
##   getPlayer(playerOrID)
##     Returns the CyPlayer given an ID or CyPlayer
##   getPlayerID(playerOrID)
##     Returns the ID given an ID or CyPlayer
##   getPlayerAndID(playerOrID)
##     Returns the ID and CyPlayer given an ID or CyPlayer
##
## Similar functions exist for Teams, Players and Teams together, and active
## versions that don't require an ID or object, using the active player instead.
## All of them return -1 and/or None if given -1 or None for playerOrId.
##
##   players(), teams(), teamPlayers(teamOrID)
##     Loops over players and teams matching various criteria.
##     Only valid objects that were alive at some point are returned, and they can
##     be filtered further by alive, human, barbarian, and/or minor status.
##
##   playerUnits(playerOrID, testFunc), playerCities(playerOrID, testFunc)
##     Loops over a player's units or cities.
##   getPlayerUnits(playerOrID, testFunc), getPlayerCities(playerOrID, testFunc)
##     Returns a list of a player's units or cities.
##
##   getStateReligion(playerOrID)
##   getFavoriteCivic(playerOrID)
##   getWorstEnemy(playerOrID, askingPlayerOrID)
##     Returns a single piece of information about the given player.
##
##   getVassals(playerOrID, askingPlayerOrID)
##   getDefensivePacts(playerOrID, askingPlayerOrID)
##     Returns lists of players with whom the given player has certain relationships.
##
##   getPossibleEmbargos(playerOrID, askingPlayerOrID)
##   getActiveWars(playerOrID, askingPlayerOrID)
##   getPossibleWars(playerOrID, askingPlayerOrID)
##   isWHEOOH(playerOrID, askingPlayerOrID)
##     Returns various information regarding the war situation for the given player.
##
## Visibility
##
##   canSeeCityList(playerOrID, askingPlayerOrID)
##     Returns True if askingPlayerOrID can see the list of playerOrID's cities.
