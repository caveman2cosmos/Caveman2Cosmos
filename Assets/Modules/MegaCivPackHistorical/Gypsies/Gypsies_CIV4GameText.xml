		<English>[TAB]The Romani (also spelled Romany), or Roma, are a traditionally itinerant ethnicity living 
mostly in Europe and the Americas. Ultimately of Northern Indian origin, the Romani are widely known 
among English-speaking people by the exonym "Gypsies" (or Gipsies). Other exonyms are Ashkali and Balkan 
Egyptians and Sinti. Romani are dispersed, with their concentrated populations in Europe—especially Central 
and Eastern Europe and Anatolia, Spain and Southern France. They originated in India and arrived in Mid-West 
Asia, then Europe, around 1,000 years ago, either separating from the Dom people or, at least, having 
a similar history; the ancestors of both the Romani and the Dom left North India sometime between the 
sixth and eleventh century. Since the nineteenth century, some Romani have also migrated to the Americas. 
There are an estimated one million Roma in the United States; and 800,000 in Brazil, most of whose ancestors 
emigrated in the nineteenth century from eastern Europe. Brazil also includes some Romani descended from 
people deported by the government of Portugal during the Inquisition in the colonial era. In migrations 
since the late nineteenth century, Romani have also moved to other countries in South America and to 
Canada. The Romani language is divided into several dialects, which add up to an estimated number of 
speakers larger than two million. The total number of Romani people is at least twice as large (several 
times as large according to high estimates). Many Romani are native speakers of the language current 
in their country of residence, or of mixed languages combining the two; those varieties are sometimes 
called Para-Romani.</English>

		<English>[H1]Stefan Razvan [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Romani Voivode[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] died 
December 1595[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Ștefan Răzvan was a Voivode 
(Prince) of Moldavia (between 24 April 1595 and August 1595) of Romani descent from the historical Romanian 
state of Wallachia. The father of Ștefan Răzvan was a Muslim Rom from the Ottoman Empire who emigrated 
north of Danube, in Wallachia, while his mother was a Romanian peasant from the new country of settlement. 
At that time, all the Romani people living in the Romanian states of Wallachia and Moldavia were slaves. 
The rule was applied also to any Romani immigrants, excepting the Ottoman citizens. Benefiting of this 
exception, the father and later the son could remain free and become an active part in the local society. 
Stefan Razvan appears as a political player at the beginning of Michael the Brave's rule in Wallachia 
(1593–1601), as a close noble ally of the Wallachian Prince. He previously converted from Islam to Christianity, 
attracting the wrath of the Ottomans. He had the boyar social status and he was a cultured person. Later 
he becomes involved in the politics of the neighbouring Romanian country of Moldavia, where he was appointed 
as part of the Princiary council, with the title of hatman (second in rank in the army after the Prince), 
during the reign of Aaron the Tyrant. He led the campaigns of the Moldavian army against Tighina, Chilia, 
Cetatea Albă and Northern Dobruja, then occupied by the Ottomans. Ștefan became very popular among the 
soldiers and, with their support and with the help of the Transylvanian Prince Sigismund Báthory, he 
ousted Aaron the Tyrant (whose image was eroded among the population), on 24 April 1595. His leadership 
did not last long, because the neighboring political power, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth did not 
agree with Ștefan Răzvan's alliance with Transylvania and Wallachia. They invaded Moldavia in August, 
bringing Ieremia Movilă as the Prince accepted by the Poles. The decisive battle was on the Suceava's 
plains (on 3 December 1595), concluded, after three hours of fight, with the Polish victory. Ștefan fled 
towards Transylvania, but he was captured and impaled.</English>
