		<English>[TAB]Illyrian culture is believed to have evolved from the Stone Age and to have manifested 
itself in the territory of [LINK=CIVILIZATION_ALBANIA]Albania[\LINK] toward the beginning of the Bronze 
Age, about 2000 BC. The Illyrians were not a uniform body of people but a conglomeration of many tribes 
that inhabited the western part of the Balkans, from what is now Slovenia in the northwest to and including 
the region of Epirus, which extends about halfway down the mainland of modern Greece.  At various times, 
groups of Illyrians migrated over land and sea into Italy.[PARAGRAPH:2] In general, Illyrians in the 
highlands of Albania were more isolated than those in the lowlands, and their culture evolved more slowly--a 
distinction that persisted throughout Albania's history.  The name Albania is derived from the name of 
an Illyrian tribe called the Arben, or Arbneshë, and later Albani, that lived near Durrës. The Illyrians 
carried on commerce and warfare with their neighbors. The ancient Macedonians probably had some Illyrian 
roots, but their ruling class adopted Greek cultural characteristics. The Illyrians also mingled with 
the Thracians, another ancient people with adjoining lands on the east. In the south and along the Adriatic 
Sea coast, the Illyrians were heavily influenced by the Greeks, who founded trading colonies there. The 
present-day city of Durrës evolved from a Greek colony known as Epidamnos, which was founded at the end 
of the seventh century B.C. Another famous Greek colony, Apollonia, arose between Durrës and the port 
city of Vlorë.[PARAGRAPH:2] The Illyrians produced and traded cattle, horses, agricultural goods, and 
wares fashioned from locally mined copper and iron. Feuds and warfare were constant facts of life for 
the Illyrian tribes, and Illyrian pirates plagued shipping on the Adriatic Sea. Councils of elders chose 
the chieftains who headed each of the numerous Illyrian tribes. From time to time, local chieftains extended 
their rule over other tribes and formed short-lived kingdoms. During the fifth century B.C., a well-developed 
Illyrian population center existed as far north as the upper Sava River valley in what is now Slovenia. 
Illyrian friezes discovered near the present-day Slovenian city of Ljubljana depict ritual sacrifices, 
feasts, battles, sporting events, and other activities.[PARAGRAPH:2] The Illyrian kingdom of Bardhyllus 
became a formidable local power in the fourth century B.C. In 358 B.C., however, Macedonia's Philip II, 
father of Alexander the Great, defeated the Illyrians and assumed control of their territory as far as 
Lake Ohrid. Alexander himself routed the forces of the Illyrian chieftain Clitus in 335 B.C., and Illyrian 
tribal leaders and soldiers accompanied Alexander on his conquest of Persia. After Alexander's death 
in 323 B.C., independent Illyrian kingdoms again arose. In 312 B.C., King Glaucius expelled the Greeks 
from Durrës. By the end of the third century, an Illyrian kingdom based near what is now the Albanian 
city of Shkodër controlled parts of northern Albania, Montenegro, and Hercegovina. Under Queen Teuta, 
Illyrians attacked Roman merchant vessels plying the Adriatic Sea and gave Rome an excuse to invade the 
Balkans.[PARAGRAPH:2] In the Illyrian Wars of 229 and 219 B.C., Rome overran the Illyrian settlements 
in the Neretva River valley. The Romans made new gains in 168 B.C., and Roman forces captured Illyria's 
King Gentius at Shkodër, which they called Scodra, and brought him to Rome in 165 B.C. A century later, 
Julius Caesar and his rival Pompey fought their decisive battle near Durrës (Dyrrachium). Rome finally 
subjugated recalcitrant Illyrian tribes in the western Balkans dwing the region of Emperor Tiberius in 
A.D. 9. The Romans divided the lands that make up present-day Albania among the provinces of Macedonia, 
Dalmatia, and Epirus.[PARAGRAPH:2] For about four centuries, Roman rule brought the Illyrian-populated 
lands economic and cultural advancement and ended most of the enervating clashes among local tribes. 
The Illyrian mountain clansmen retained local authority but pledged allegiance to the emperor and acknowledged 
the authority of his envoys. During a yearly holiday honoring the Caesars, the Illyrian mountaineers 
swore loyalty to the emperor and reaffirmed their political rights. A form of this tradition, known as 
the kuvend, has survived to the present day in northern Albania.[PARAGRAPH:2] The Romans established 
numerous military camps and colonies and latinized the coastal cities. They also oversaw the construction 
of aqueducts and roads, including the Via Egnatia, a famous military highway and trade route that led 
from Durrës through the Shkumbin River valley to Macedonia and Byzantium (later Constantinople). Copper, 
asphalt, and silver were extracted from the mountains. The main exports were wine, cheese, oil, and fish 
from Lake Scutari (Shkodra) and Lake Ohrid. Imports included tools, metalware, luxury goods, and other 
manufactured articles. Apollonia became a cultural center, and Julius Caesar himself sent his nephew, 
later the Emperor Augustus, to study there.[PARAGRAPH:2] Illyrians distinguished themselves as warriors 
in the Roman legions and made up a significant portion of the Praetorian Guard. Several of the Roman 
emperors were of Illyrian origin, including Diocletian (284-305), who saved the empire from disintegration 
by introducing institutional reforms, and Constantine the Great (324-37)--who accepted Christianity and 
transferred the empire's capital from Rome to Byzantium, which he called Constantinople. Emperor Justinian 
(527-65)--who codified Roman law, built the most famous Byzantine church, the Hagia Sofia, and reextended 
the empire's control over lost territories- -was probably also an Illyrian.[PARAGRAPH:2] Christianity 
came to the Illyrian-populated lands in the first century A.D. Saint Paul wrote that he preached in the 
Roman province of Illyricum, and legend holds that he visited Durrës. When the Roman Empire was divided 
into eastern and western halves in A.D. 395, the lands that now make up Albania were administered by 
the Eastern Empire but were ecclesiastically dependent on Rome. In A.D. 732, however, a Byzantine emperor, 
Leo the Isaurian, subordinated the area to the patriarchate of Constantinople. For centuries thereafter, 
the Albanian lands became an arena for the ecclesiastical struggle between Rome and Constantinople. Most 
Albanians living in the mountainous north became Roman Catholic, while in the southern and central regions, 
the majority became Orthodox.</English>

subjugated recalcitrant Illyrian tribes in the western Balkans dwing the region of Emperor Tiberius in 
A.D. 9. The Romans divided the lands that make up present-day Albania among the provinces of Macedonia, 
Dalmatia, and Epirus.[PARAGRAPH:2] For about four centuries, Roman rule brought the Illyrian-populated

the kuvend, has survived to the present day in northern Albania.[PARAGRAPH:2] The Romans established 
numerous military camps and colonies and latinized the coastal cities. They also oversaw the construction 
of aqueducts and roads, including the Via Egnatia, a famous military highway and trade route that led 
from Durrës through the Shkumbin River valley to Macedonia and Byzantium (later Constantinople). Copper, 
asphalt, and silver were extracted from the mountains. The main exports were wine, cheese, oil, and fish 
from Lake Scutari (Shkodra) and Lake Ohrid. Imports included tools, metalware, luxury goods, and other 
manufactured articles. Apollonia became a cultural center, and Julius Caesar himself sent his nephew,

emperors were of Illyrian origin, including Diocletian (284-305), who saved the empire from disintegration 
by introducing institutional reforms, and Constantine the Great (324-37)--who accepted Christianity and 
transferred the empire's capital from Rome to Byzantium, which he called Constantinople. Emperor Justinian

the empire's control over lost territories- -was probably also an Illyrian.[PARAGRAPH:2] Christianity 
came to the Illyrian-populated lands in the first century A.D. Saint Paul wrote that he preached in the 
Roman province of Illyricum, and legend holds that he visited Durrës. When the Roman Empire was divided

the Eastern Empire but were ecclesiastically dependent on Rome. In A.D. 732, however, a Byzantine emperor, 
Leo the Isaurian, subordinated the area to the patriarchate of Constantinople. For centuries thereafter, 
the Albanian lands became an arena for the ecclesiastical struggle between Rome and Constantinople. Most

		<Italian>[TAB]Illyrian culture is believed to have evolved from the Stone Age and to have manifested 
itself in the territory of [LINK=CIVILIZATION_ALBANIA]Albania[\LINK] toward the beginning of the Bronze 
Age, about 2000 BC. The Illyrians were not a uniform body of people but a conglomeration of many tribes 
that inhabited the western part of the Balkans, from what is now Slovenia in the northwest to and including 
the region of Epirus, which extends about halfway down the mainland of modern Greece.  At various times, 
groups of Illyrians migrated over land and sea into Italy.[PARAGRAPH:2] In general, Illyrians in the 
highlands of Albania were more isolated than those in the lowlands, and their culture evolved more slowly--a 
distinction that persisted throughout Albania's history.  The name Albania is derived from the name of 
an Illyrian tribe called the Arben, or Arbneshë, and later Albani, that lived near Durrës. The Illyrians 
carried on commerce and warfare with their neighbors. The ancient Macedonians probably had some Illyrian 
roots, but their ruling class adopted Greek cultural characteristics. The Illyrians also mingled with 
the Thracians, another ancient people with adjoining lands on the east. In the south and along the Adriatic 
Sea coast, the Illyrians were heavily influenced by the Greeks, who founded trading colonies there. The 
present-day city of Durrës evolved from a Greek colony known as Epidamnos, which was founded at the end 
of the seventh century B.C. Another famous Greek colony, Apollonia, arose between Durrës and the port 
city of Vlorë.[PARAGRAPH:2] The Illyrians produced and traded cattle, horses, agricultural goods, and 
wares fashioned from locally mined copper and iron. Feuds and warfare were constant facts of life for 
the Illyrian tribes, and Illyrian pirates plagued shipping on the Adriatic Sea. Councils of elders chose 
the chieftains who headed each of the numerous Illyrian tribes. From time to time, local chieftains extended 
their rule over other tribes and formed short-lived kingdoms. During the fifth century B.C., a well-developed 
Illyrian population center existed as far north as the upper Sava River valley in what is now Slovenia. 
Illyrian friezes discovered near the present-day Slovenian city of Ljubljana depict ritual sacrifices, 
feasts, battles, sporting events, and other activities.[PARAGRAPH:2] The Illyrian kingdom of Bardhyllus 
became a formidable local power in the fourth century B.C. In 358 B.C., however, Macedonia's Philip II, 
father of Alexander the Great, defeated the Illyrians and assumed control of their territory as far as 
Lake Ohrid. Alexander himself routed the forces of the Illyrian chieftain Clitus in 335 B.C., and Illyrian 
tribal leaders and soldiers accompanied Alexander on his conquest of Persia. After Alexander's death 
in 323 B.C., independent Illyrian kingdoms again arose. In 312 B.C., King Glaucius expelled the Greeks 
from Durrës. By the end of the third century, an Illyrian kingdom based near what is now the Albanian 
city of Shkodër controlled parts of northern Albania, Montenegro, and Hercegovina. Under Queen Teuta, 
Illyrians attacked Roman merchant vessels plying the Adriatic Sea and gave Rome an excuse to invade the 
Balkans.[PARAGRAPH:2] In the Illyrian Wars of 229 and 219 B.C., Rome overran the Illyrian settlements 
in the Neretva River valley. The Romans made new gains in 168 B.C., and Roman forces captured Illyria's 
King Gentius at Shkodër, which they called Scodra, and brought him to Rome in 165 B.C. A century later,

to the Aous (Vjosa river) River on the south with Shkodër as its capital, his widow, Teuta, acted as 
regent for her young stepson Pinnes. Teuta's first decision was to drive the Greek colonies off the Albanian 
coast. Attempting this, she found Durrës too well fortified but Finiq farther south surrendered. While 
her Illyrian ships were off the coast of Sarandë they intercepted and plundered some merchant vessels

The Roman Senate sent two ambassadors to the pirate lair at Shkodër to require reparations and demand 
an end to the piratical expeditions. Apparently she told the ambassadors that according to the law of 
the Illyrians, piracy was a lawful trade and that her government had no right to interfere with this 
as a private enterprise. One of the envoys is repored to have replied that in that case Rome would make

awarded him a considerable part of Teuta's holdings (228 BC). The Roman army then landed farther north 
at Apollonia. The combined army and navy proceeded northward together, subduing one town after another

peace. The Romans allowed her to continue her reign but restricted her to a narrow region around Shkodra, 
deprived her of all her other holdings, and forbade her to sail an armed ship below Lissus (Lezhë) just
