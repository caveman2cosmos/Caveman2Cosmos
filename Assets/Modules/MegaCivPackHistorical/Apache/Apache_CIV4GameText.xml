[\BOLD] 1805 - 1874[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB] Adatlichi, better known 
as 'Cochise' (meaning 'hardwood') was a chief of the Chokonen band of the Chiricahua Apache and the leader 
of an uprising that began in 1861. Cochise was described as a large man (for the time), with a muscular 
frame, classical Roman features, and long black hair which he wore in traditional Apache style. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cochise 
and the Chokonen-Chiricahua lived in the area that is now the northern Mexican region of Sonora, and 
New Mexico and Arizona, which were traditional Apache territories until the coming of the Europeans. 
Due to encroachment by Spain and later Mexico, the Chokonen and Nednhi-Chiricahua became increasingly 
dependent upon food rations issued by the Mexican government to placate them. When this practice was 
abruptly ended in 1831, the various Chiricahua bands resumed raids to acquire food. Mexican troops were 
largely unsuccessful in their attempts to address this and were often fought to a standstill by the Apache. 
As part of their attempts at controlling the Chiricahua, Mexican forces, often with the help of American 
and Native American mercenaries, began to kill Apache civilians, including Cochise's father. Mexican 
forces were finally able to capture Cochise in 1848 during an Apache raid on Fronteras, Sonora, but they 
exchanged him for nearly a dozen Mexican hostages. [PARAGRAPH:1]At Apache Pass in 1862, Cochise and his 
father-in-law, Mangas Coloradas, with 500 fighters, held their ground against a force of 3,000 California 
volunteers under Carleton until howitzer artillery fire was brought to bear on their position. The impasse 
continued until both parties agreed to parley. During what was to be a peaceful parley session, the Americans 
took the unsuspecting Mangas Coloradas prisoner and then later executed him. This continued a series 
of incidents that fanned the flames of enmity between the encroaching Americans and the Apache. For Cochise, 
the Americans held nothing sacred and had violated the rules of war by capturing Mangas Coloradas during 
a parley session. Cochise and the Apache continued their raids against American and Mexican settlements 
and military positions throughout the 1860s. [PARAGRAPH:1]Following various skirmishes, Cochise and his 
men were gradually driven into the Dragoon Mountains but were nevertheless able to use the mountains 
as cover and as a base from which to continue significant skirmishes against white settlements. This 
was the situation until 1871 when General George Crook assumed command and used other Apaches as scouts 
and informants and was thereby able to force Cochise's men to surrender. Cochise was taken into custody 
in September of that year. The next year, the Chiricahua were ordered to Tularosa Reservation in New 
Mexico but refused to leave their ancestral lands in Arizona, which were guaranteed to them under treaty. 
Cochise managed to escape again and renewed raids and skirmishes against settlements through most of 
1872. A new treaty was later negotiated by General Oliver O. Howard as the Americans relented to some 
of the Apaches' terms. Cochise quietly retired to an Arizona reservation, where he died of natural causes.</English>

[\BOLD] 1829 - 1909[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Geronimo or 'Goyathlay' 
('one who yawns') was a prominent leader of the Chiricahua Apache who long warred against the encroachment 
of settlers of European descent on tribal lands. [PARAGRAPH:1]He grew up to be a respected medicine man 
and, later, an accomplished warrior who fought frequently with Mexican troops. Mexican soldiers massacred 
his first wife and three children during a supposedly peaceful trading session in 1858, and as a result 
he hated all Mexicans for the rest of his life. His Mexican friends gave him the nickname of "Gerï¿½nimo". 
The reasons for this name are not known. Some believe it was a transcription of the Spanish attempt to 
pronounce the name Goyathlay. Others believe that his Spanish enemies called out to Saint Jerome for 
assistance while attacking or in the midst of violent defeat. [PARAGRAPH:1]Geronimo fought against ever 
increasing numbers of both Mexican and United States troops and became famous for his daring exploits 
and numerous escapes from capture. At the last, these 38 men, women and children evaded 5000 U.S. troops 
(one fourth of the army at the time) and the Mexican army for a year. His forces became the last major 
force of independent Indian warriors who refused to acknowledge the United States Government in the American 
West. This came to an end on September 4, 1886, when Geronimo surrendered to United States Army General 
Thomas W. Sampson at Skeleton Canyon, Arizona. [PARAGRAPH:1]Geronimo was sent in as a prisoner to Fort 
Pickens, Florida. In 1894 he was moved to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. In his old age Geronimo became something 
of a celebrity. He appeared at fairs, including the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, and selling souvenirs 
and photographs of himself. However, he was not allowed to return to the land of his birth. He rode in 
the United States President Theodore Roosevelt's 1905 inaugural parade. He died of pneumonia at Fort 
Sill, where he is now buried at the Apache Indian Prisoner of War cemetery. [PARAGRAPH:1]Geronimo is 
a popular figure in cinema and television. Characters based on Geronimo have appeared in many films. 
Characterisations of Geronimo also appeared in Gunsmoke: The Last Apache, and the 1993 telefilm Geronimo. 
The 1976 film I Due superpiedi quasi piatti features a character who believes himself to be Geronimo. 
The manga and anime television series Kinnikuman and Ultimate Muscle: The Kinnikuman Legacy features 
a highly stereotyped native wrestler, based loosely on the historical figure. In 1940, the night before 
their first mass jump, U.S. paratroopers at Fort Benning saw a film about Geronimo, and began shouting 
his name during jumps, a trend which has caught on elsewhere.</English>

and photographs of himself. However, he was not allowed to return to the land of his birth. He rode in 
the United States President Theodore Roosevelt's 1905 inaugural parade. He died of pneumonia at Fort 
Sill, where he is now buried at the Apache Indian Prisoner of War cemetery. [PARAGRAPH:1]Geronimo is 
a popular figure in cinema and television. Characters based on Geronimo have appeared in many films. 
Characterisations of Geronimo also appeared in Gunsmoke: The Last Apache, and the 1993 telefilm Geronimo. 
The 1976 film I Due superpiedi quasi piatti features a character who believes himself to be Geronimo. 
The manga and anime television series Kinnikuman and Ultimate Muscle: The Kinnikuman Legacy features 
a highly stereotyped native wrestler, based loosely on the historical figure. In 1940, the night before 
their first mass jump, U.S. paratroopers at Fort Benning saw a film about Geronimo, and began shouting 
his name during jumps, a trend which has caught on elsewhere.</German>

pronounce the name Goyathlay. Others believe that his Spanish enemies called out to Saint Jerome for

		<English>[TAB]Natives of the inhospitable southwestern United States and northern Mexico, the Apache 
were nomadic people who built their society on a balance of commerce and raids. Thanks in part to their 
nomadic lifestyle and harsh homeland, the Apache were considered among the most formidable mounted warriors 
of the southwest. The name Apache itself came from a Zuni native word meaning "enemy." [PARAGRAPH:2]The 
Spanish were the first to encounter the Apache when Francisco de Coronado, the Spanish conquistador who 
combed the American Southwest in the 16th century, met and traded with them. Relations between the Apache 
and the colonists remained relatively benign until the 19th century, when Mexico declared its independence 
from Spain. In the 1830s, seeking to gain control of the Southwest, the Mexican government began offering 
a reward for the scalps of the Apache. [PARAGRAPH:2]The violence that followed led many Apache, normally 
a series of independent tribes, to unite under the leadership of Mangas Coloradas. Coloradas' war against 
the Mexicans would continue for almost a decade before the United States, declaring war in 1846, defeated 
Mexico and laid claim to their territories. Coloradas agreed to sign a treaty with the Americans in return 
for self-sovereignty, but it did not last. The discovery of a wealth of minerals in Apache territory 
brought white settlers flocking to their lands. Seeing them as trespassers, the Apache led raids against 
the American settlers. In response, the US military sent forth troops to make war on the Apache. The 
ensuing conflict, which became known as the Apache Wars, continued for roughly ten years. [PARAGRAPH:2]During 
this time, Mangas Coloradas, as well as the Apache leader Cochise and the medicine man Geronimo, led 
guerilla forces against the Americans. The decade of war took its toll on the Apache - Coloradas was 
captured and executed during a treaty negotiation in 1863 and Cochise too was captured. To help stem 
the tide of violence, the American government authorized the creation of a reservation in San Carlos, 
Arizona, where the Apache could live separated from the white settlers. At first the Apache agreed to 
live on the territory, but found the restricting life on the reservation little to their liking. Geronimo 
along with numerous others escaped from the reservation on multiple occasions to wreak havoc on American 
encampments. During his final escape in 1886, nearly 6000 soldiers and volunteers were mobilized to try 
and recapture the Apache leader. [PARAGRAPH:2]After the surrender of Geronimo later that year, there 
was a great demand among the white settlers that the Apache be relocated, as it was clear the reservation 
could not hold them. Bowing to their constituents' demands, the American government scattered the Apache 
to the four winds. Some were moved east to Oklahoma. Geromino and his followers were imprisoned in Florida 
and not allowed to return to their home territory until 1914. Today, most modern Apache still live in 
the same region as their ancestors - Arizona and New Mexico, with many still living on their original 
reservation at San Carlos.</English>
