		<English>[TAB]The Goths orginated from Scandinavia (more particularly, Gotland or Götaland; Jordanes' Scandza). In about 1st century BC they would have become separated from related tribes, the Gutar (Gotlanders) and the Götar (Geats), which are sometimes included in the term Goths. They settled in modern-day Poland (regions East Pommern and Kuyavia, Jordanes' Gothiscandza) and mixed with local population forming Wielbark culture. They slowly migrated along the Wisla river (Vistula, Weichsel) during the 1st century , settling in Scythia (modern day Ukraine), which they called Oium "waterlands", where in 2nd century they formed multiethnical kingdom. Apart from Goths, it included Alans and probably Slavic people. [PARAGRAPH:2]According to legendary accounts, the capital of this kingdom was Arheimar ("the river house"), at the Dniepr. In 3rd Century Goths split into two groups, the Tervingi ("Forest Goths") or Visigoths ("West Goths") west of Dniester, and the Greuthungi ("Steppe Goths") or Ostrogoths ("East Goths") east of it. The Visigoths launched one of the first major "barbarian" invasions of the Roman Empire from 263, sacking Byzantium in 267. A year later, they suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Naissus and were driven back across the Danube River by 271. This group then settled north of the Danube and established an independent kingdom centered on the abandoned Roman province of Dacia. Both the Ostrogoths and Visigoths became heavily Romanized during the 4th century by the influence of trade with the Byzantines, and by their membership in a military covenant centered in Byzantium to assist each other militarily. They converted to Arianism during this time, which was later a reason for animosity between Goths and catholic Franks, Byzantines and conquered roman polulation. [PARAGRAPH:2]Hun domination of the Ostrogoth kingdom began in the 370s, and under pressure of the Huns, Visigothic king Fritigern in 376 asked Valens to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the Danube. Valens permitted this, and even helped the Goths cross the river, probably at the fortress of Durostorum, but following a famine the Gothic War (377-382) erupted, and Valens was killed at the Battle of Adrianople. The Visigoths under Alaric I sacked Rome in 410. Honorius granted the Visigoths Aquitania, where they defeated the Vandals and by 475 ruled most of the Iberian peninsula. The Ostrogoths in the meantime freed themselves of government of the Huns following the Battle of Nedao in 454. At the behest of emporor Zeno, Theoderic the Great from 488 conquered all of Italy. The Goths were briefly reunited under one crown in the early sixth century under Theodoric the Great, who became regent of the Visigothic kingdom following the death of Alaric II at the Battle of Vouillé in 507. The Ostrogothic kingdom persisted until 553 under Teia, when Italy briefly fell back under Byzantine control, until the conquest of the Langobards in 572. The Visigothic kingdom lasted longer. Driven from the north of Pyrenees by Franks after the Battle of Vouillé, Visigoths ruled most of the Iberian Pennisula. The last Arian Visigothic king, Liuvigild, conquered the Suevi kingdom in 585 and most of the northern regions (Cantabria) in 574 and regained part of the southern areas lost to the Byzantines, which his heir Reccared conquered completely in 624. [PARAGRAPH:2]In January 587 Reccared renounced Arianism for Catholicism and after a short civil war converted whole kingdom to catholicism. Catholic bishops increased in power, and at the synod held at Toledo in 633, they took upon themselves the nobles' right to select a king from among the royal family. In 654 The Visigothic Code of Law (forum judicum) which had been part of aristocratic oral tradition, was set in writing . It goes into more detail than a modern constitution commonly does and reveals a great deal about Visigothic social structure. The laws combine the Catholic Church's Canon law, and has a strongly theocratic tone. In 711 King Roderic (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing an invasion from the south by the Umayyad Muslims in the Battle of Guadalete on July 19. This marked the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Iberia in which most of peninsula came under Islamic rule by 718. A Visigothic nobleman, Pelayo, is credited with beginning the Christian Reconquista of Iberia in 718, when he defeated the Umayyads in battle and established the Kingdom of Asturias (that kept for a while the name Gothia) in the northern part of the peninsula. It was the beginning of modern-day Spain. Some of the Ostrogoths, on the other hand, remained at the Black Sea, and formed principality around Doros (modern Mangup) in southern Crimea. While initially Arian, they converted in V century to catholicsm and after it split followed the eastern path. The principality was a vassal of different powers (Byzantium, Khazars, Kievan Rus, Mongols, Genoa) until finally in XVI century it was incorporated into Ottoman Empire. The gothic communites survived until late XVII century, when many were deported by Catherine the Great. Their language vanished by the 1800's.</English>

Between 395 and 397, he led the Visigoths in devastating Thrace and Greece, sacking several cities including Corinth and Sparta. He invaded Italy in 401 and besieged the Western Roman emperor Flavius Honorius (395-423) in Milan. In 402, after being defeated at Pollentia and Verona by the Western Empire general Stilicho, he moved into the province of Noricum, just north of Italy.[PARAGRAPH:1]Following Stilicho's murder in 408, Alaric invaded Italy after Honorius refused to pay him for past services. A siege of Rome was alternately lifted and renewed. Finally, on August 24, 410, after being joined by his relative Athaulf, Alaric captured Rome. The city was sacked for three days; churches were generally left untouched. The damage was more psychological than material. For the first time in 800 years, Rome had fallen. No longer could it be called "Unconquered Rome."[PARAGRAPH:1]Alaric then traveled south, hoping to cross to Sicily, but after the Gothic fleet was wrecked, he turned back north. On this journey, he became ill and died at Cosentia in southern Italy.[PARAGRAPH:1]It is said that Alaric was buried with his treasures in the bed of the Busento River, which was temporarily diverted from its course. That the secret of his burial place might be kept, the slaves employed in the labor were killed.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>

		<German>[H1]Alaric I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of the Visigoths[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.370 - 410 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]After serving in the campaigns of Emperor Theodosius I against the western usurper Eugenius in 394, the Visigothic chieftain Alaric revolted, displeased because he had not received sufficient reward. Between 395 and 397, he led the Visigoths in devastating Thrace and Greece, sacking several cities including Corinth and Sparta. He invaded Italy in 401 and besieged the Western Roman emperor Flavius Honorius (395-423) in Milan. In 402, after being defeated at Pollentia and Verona by the Western Empire general Stilicho, he moved into the province of Noricum, just north of Italy.[PARAGRAPH:1]Following Stilicho's murder in 408, Alaric invaded Italy after Honorius refused to pay him for past services. A siege of Rome was alternately lifted and renewed. Finally, on August 24, 410, after being joined by his relative Athaulf, Alaric captured Rome.
