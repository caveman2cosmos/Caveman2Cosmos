		<English>[TAB]Archaeological remains have been found throughout peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. 
The Semang have a deep ancestry within the Malay Peninsula, dating to the initial settlement from Africa 
over 50,000 years ago. The Senoi appear to be a composite group, with approximately half of the maternal 
lineages tracing back to the ancestors of the Semang and about half to Indochina. This is in agreement 
with the suggestion that they represent the descendants of early Austronesian speaking agriculturalists, 
who brought both their language and their technology to the southern part of the peninsula approximately 
5,000 years ago and coalesced with the indigenous population.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Buddhist kingdom of Ligor 
took control of Kedah shortly after, and its King Chandrabhanu used it as a base to attack Sri Lanka 
in the 11th century, an event noted in a stone inscription in Nagapattinum in Tamil Nadu and in the Sri 
Lankan chronicles, Mahavamsa. During the first millennium, the people of the Malay Peninsula adopted 
Hinduism and Buddhism and the use of the Sanskrit language until they eventually converted to Islam.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 
the early-15th century, the Malacca Sultanate was established under a dynasty founded by Parameswara 
, a prince from Palembang within the Srivijayan empire. Conquest forced him and many others to flee Palembang. 
Parameswara in particular sailed to Temasek to escape persecution and came under the protection of Temagi, 
a Malay chief from Patani who was appointed by the King of Siam as Regent of Temasek.[PARAGRAPH:2]Modern 
Malaysia is a country that consists of thirteen states and three federal territories in Southeast Asia. 
The capital city is Kuala Lumpur, while Putrajaya is the seat of the federal government. The population 
stands at over 27 million.The country is separated into two regions  Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian 
Borneo  by the South China Sea. Malaysia borders Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines. 
The country is located near the equator and experiences a tropical climate. Malaysia's head of state 
is the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and the government is headed by a Prime Minister. The government is closely 
modeled after the Westminster parliamentary system.[PARAGRAPH:2]Malaysia as a unified state did not exist 
until 1963. Previously, a set of colonies were established by the United Kingdom from the late-18th century, 
and the western half of modern Malaysia was composed of several separate kingdoms. This group of colonies 
was known as British Malaya until its dissolution in 1946, when it was reorganized as the Malayan Union. 
Due to widespread opposition, it was reorganized again as the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and later 
gained independence on 31 August 1957. At one time, it was the largest producer of tin, rubber and palm 
oil in the world. Manufacturing has a large influence in the country's economy. Malaysia has a biodiverse 
range of flora and fauna, and is also considered one of the 18 megadiverse countries.[PARAGRAPH:2]Malaysia

[\BOLD] 1925 - [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad 
was the fourth Prime Minister of Malaysia. He held the post for 22 years from 1981 to 2003, making him 
Malaysia's longest-serving Prime Minister, and one of the longest-serving leaders in Asia. During his 
term in office, he was credited for engineering Malaysia's rapid modernization and promoting non-individualistic 
"Asian values". Mahathir is also known for his criticisms of western and developed countries. During 
his administration, he was considered as one of Asia's most influential leaders. Mahathir is also noted 
in the Western world as an outspoken critic of Western civilization.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1983 and 1991, he 
took on the federal and state monarchies, removing the royal veto and royal immunity from prosecution.Prior 
to this amendment of the law, royal assent was required in order for any bill to pass into law. During 
the Asian financial crisis of 1997, IMF had prescribed a recovery package for Malaysia, but Mahathir 
defied international pressure, his then Deputy Anwar Ibrahim, and conventional wisdom in rejecting the 
package. Though economic prosperity has been mixed since then, Mahathir argued that Malaysia's recovery 
was relatively faster and better, as compared to many other Asian countries affected. After the financial 
crisis, the IMF and World Bank acknowledged that Mahathir's approach had worked.[PARAGRAPH:1]For his 
efforts to promote the economic development of the country, Mahathir has been granted the soubriquet 
of Bapa Ketuanan Melayu (Father of Malay Supremacy). Since his resignation, there are signs that his 
influence is on the wane, notably the cancellation of a Mahathir-approved double tracking rail project 
on grounds of cost.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mahathir's official residence, Sri Perdana, where he resided from 23 
August 1983 to 18 October 1999, was turned into a museum (Galeria Sri Perdana). In keeping with the principle 
of heritage conservation, the original design and layout of the Sri Perdana has been preserved.</English>
