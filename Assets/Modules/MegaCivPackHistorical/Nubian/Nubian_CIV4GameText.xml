		<English>[TAB]The Kingdom of Nubia was an ancient African state situated on the confluences of the 
Blue Nile, White Nile and River Atbara in what is now the Republic of Sudan.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Established 
after the Bronze Age collapse and the disintegration of the New Kingdom of Egypt, it was centered at 
Napata in its early phase. After king Kashta invaded Egypt in the 8th century BC, the Nubian kings ruled 
as Pharaohs of the Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt for a century, until they were expelled by Psamtik I 
in 656 BC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]During Classical Antiquity, the Nubian imperial capital was at Meroe. 
In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as Ethiopia. The Nubian kingdom with its capital 
at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion. 
The Nubian capital was subsequently captured by the Beja Dynasty, who tried to revive the empire. The 
Nubian capital was eventually captured and destroyed by the kingdom of Axum. After the collapse of the 
Nubian empire several states emerged in its former territories, among them Nubia.</English>
		<French>eported in the annals of other nations. The first noticeable cultures in Nubia include first 
the Badarian culture, then the Amratian and finally the Gerzean. From the Gerzean the first native culture 
developed known as the A-Group, which began roughly at the same time as the First dynasty of Egypt around 
3100 BC. It consisted of semi-nomadic groups who subsided by herding sheep, goats, and some cattle. It 
is known from its distinctive burial rituals and pottery. Prehistoric tools discovered in Nubia date 
to circa 65,000 BC, found along the Nile Valley.[PARAGRAPH:2]This culture began to decline in the early-28th 
century BC. The succeeding culture is known as B-Group. Previously, the B-Group people were thought to 
have invaded from elsewhere. Today most historians believe that B-Group was merely A-Group but far poorer. 
The causes of this is uncertain, but it was perhaps caused by Egyptian invasions and pillaging that began 
at this time.[PARAGRAPH:2]As trade between Egypt and Nubia increased so did wealth and stability. By 
the Egyptian 6th dynasty, Nubia was divided into a series of small kingdoms. There is debate over whether 
these C-Group peoples, who flourished from c. 2240 BC to c. 2150 BC, were another internal evolution 
or invaders. There are definite similarities between the pottery of A-Group and C-Group, so it may be 
a return of the ousted Group-As, or an internal revival of lost arts. At this time, the Sahara Desert 
was becoming too arid to support human beings, and it is possible that there was a sudden influx of Saharan 
nomads. C-Group pottery is characterized by all-over incised geometric lines with white infill and impressed 
imitations of basketry.[PARAGRAPH:2]A contemporaneous but distinct culture from the C-Group was the Pan 
Grave culture, so called because of their shallow graves. The Pan Graves are associated with the East 
bank of the Nile, but the Pan Graves and C-Group defintiely interacted. Their pottery is characterized 
by incised lines of a more limited character than those of the C-Group, generally having interspersed 
undecorated spaces within the geometric scheme. From the C-Group culture, the first kingdom to unify 
much of the region arose, the Kingdom of Kerma, named for its presumed capital at Kerma. When Egyptian 
power revived under the New Kingdom they began to expand southwards. By the end of the reign of Thutmose 
I in 1520 BC, all of northern Nubia had been annexed.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nubia[PARAGRAPH:2]When the Egyptians 
pulled out, they left a lasting legacy that was merged with indigenous customs forming the kingdom of 
Nubia. Nubia adopted many Egyptian practices such as their religion and the practice of building pyramids. 
The kingdom of Nubia survived longer than that of Egypt, even invading and controlling Egypt itself for 
a period (the Nubian dynasty) in the 8th century BC. Nubia was never annexed by the Romans. The Nubians 
did trade with the Romans, and were also a source of mercenaries.[PARAGRAPH:2]During this time, the different 
parts of the region divided into smaller groups with individual leaders, or generals, each commanding 
small armies of mercenaries. They fought for control of what is now Nubia and its surrounding territories, 
leaving the entire region weak and vulnerable to attack.[PARAGRAPH:2]At some point, Nubia was conquered 
by the Noba people, from which the name Nubia may derive (another possibility is that it comes from Nub, 
the Egyptian word for gold). From then on, the Romans referred to the area as the Nobatae. Indeed, recent 
studies in population genetics suggest that there was a south-north gene flow through the Nile Valley. 
[2] Similarly, linguistic evidence suggests that the Nubians from the Nile Valley originally came from 
the south or southwest. Historical comparative research into the Nubian language group has indicated 
that the Nile-Nubian languages must have split off from the Nubian languages still spoken in the Nuba 
Mountains in Kordofan, Sudan, at least 2500 years ago.[PARAGRAPH:2]Present-day Sudan is the largest country 
by area in Africa, situated in North Africa. In 1820, Sudan came under Egyptian rule when Mehemet Ali, 
the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, sent armies led by his son Ismail Pasha and Mahommed Bey to conquer eastern 
Sudan. In the 1880s, religious leader Muhammad ibn Abdalla, self-proclaimed Mahdi (Messiah), attempted 
to unify the tribes of western and central Sudan. He led a nationalist revolt against Egyptian rule culminating 
in the fall of Khartoum in 1885, in which the British General Gordon was killed, and during which a tribe 
in the region of Port Sudan inspired Rudyard Kipling's poem Fuzzy Wuzzy. But in 1898, the Mahdist state 
was overwhelmed by an Anglo-Egyptian force under Lord Kitchener. Great Britain ran Sudan as two essentially 
separate colonies, the south and the north, until 1956.[PARAGRAPH:2]The year before independence in 1956, 
Southern Sudanese embarked upon a civil war. During British rule, it was illegal for people living above 
the 10th parallel to go further south and people above the 8th parallel further north. The law was enacted 
to prevent the spread of malaria and other tropical diseases that had ravaged British troops. This sparked 
17 years of civil war from 1955 to 1972. In 1972, the Addis Ababa Agreement led to a cessation of the 
north-south civil war and a degree of self-rule. This led to a ten-year hiatus in the civil war.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 
September 1983, President Gaafar Nimeiry, created a Federated Sudan which included 3 federal states in 
Southern Sudan. It was the introduction of Sharia law and the dissolution of the 3 federal states in 
the South that led to the reinvigoration of the civil war.</French>

		<English>[H1]Taharqa[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Nubia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.710 BC 
- 664 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Taharqa was a Nubian pharaoh of Egypt. 
He was the last ruler of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, the so-called Ethiopian Dynasty, and was driven out 
of Lower Egypt by the Assyrians as they began to conquer Egypt. [PARAGRAPH:1]When Shabaka conquered Lower 
Egypt and thus asserted Nubian rule, he was accompanied by his nephew Taharqa, who was about age 20. 
Later, during Shabaka's reign as pharaoh, Egypt confronted the growing might of Assyria on the battlefield. 
Taharqa was at the head of the Egyptian army, but it is not clear whether the two forces actually fought. 
Taharqa's brother Shabataka succeeded Shabaka, and he made Taharqa his coregent in order to assure his 
succession. About 688 BC, approximately 23 years after Nubian rule had been imposed over Egypt, Taharqa 
assumed the throne in his own right. [PARAGRAPH:1]The next few years were peaceful, and Taharqa moved 
his capital to Tanis in the Delta so that he could stay well informed about events in the neighboring 
Asian countries. By 671 BC Egypt and Assyria again approached a confrontation, so Taharqa prepared to 
fight for the continued survival of Egypt. But the Assyrian king, Esarhaddon, crossed the Sinai Desert 
and defeated Taharqa's army on the frontier. In 2 weeks he was besieging Memphis. The Egyptian army crumbled 
under the attack of the better-disciplined Assyrian army, which was armed with iron weapons. [PARAGRAPH:1]Taharqa 
fled to Upper Egypt, leaving Esarhaddon to take control of Lower Egypt. Two years later Taharqa returned 
with a fresh army and managed to recover control of the Delta, but this success was short-lived, and 
Esarhaddon's successor, Ashurbanipal, drove Taharqa south again. After this final defeat he never again 
tried to campaign in the north. Egypt then entered into a long era of successive foreign rulers. [PARAGRAPH:1]During 
his period of Egyptian rule Taharqa had encouraged many architectural projects, as had his Nubian predecessors. 
He indulged in rebuilding the temple at Kawa, across the Nile from present-day Dongola, which became 
a major center for the Nubian kings. He erected monuments at Karnak, Thebes, and Tanis in Lower Egypt, 
and he built a number of important temples in Nubia, as the Upper Egyptian Nubian state was then known. 
During the last 8 years of his life in Nubia, he continued to foster his architectural interests. [PARAGRAPH:1]It 
was during his reign that Egypt's enemy Assyria at last invaded Egypt. Esarhaddon led several campaigns 
against Taharqa, which he recorded on several monuments. His first attack in 677 BC, aimed to pacify 
Arab tribes around the Dead Sea, led him as far as the Brook of Egypt. Esarhaddon invaded Egypt proper 
in Taharqa's 17th regnal year, after Esarhaddon had settled a revolt at Ashkelon. Taharqa defeated the 
Assyrians on that occasion, but three years later (671 BC) the Assyrian king captured and sacked Memphis, 
where he captured numerous members of the royal family. Taharqa fled to the south, and Esarhaddon reorganized 
the political scene in the north, establishing Necho I of the 26th dynasty as king at Sais. [PARAGRAPH:1]Upon 
the Assyrian king's departure, however, Taharqa intrigued in the affairs of Lower Egypt, and fanned numerous 
revolts. Esarhaddon died before he could return to Egypt, and it was left to his heir Assurbanipal to 
once again invade Egypt. Assurbanipal defeated Taharqa, who afterwards fled first to Thebes, then up 
the Nile into Nubia. After appointing Tantamani, the son of Shabaka, as his successor, he died in exile 
and was buried at El-Kurru.</English>

foreign rulers. [PARAGRAPH:1]During his period of Egyptian rule Taharqa had encouraged many architectural 
projects, as had his Nubian predecessors. He indulged in rebuilding the temple at Kawa, across the Nile 
from present-day Dongola, which became a major center for the Nubian kings. He erected monuments at Karnak, 
Thebes, and Tanis in Lower Egypt, and he built a number of important temples in Nubia, as the Upper Egyptian 
Nubian state was then known. During the last 8 years of his life in Nubia, he continued to foster his 
architectural interests. [PARAGRAPH:1]It was during his reign that Egypt's enemy Assyria at last invaded 
Egypt. Esarhaddon led several campaigns against Taharqa, which he recorded on several monuments. His 
first attack in 677 BC, aimed to pacify Arab tribes around the Dead Sea, led him as far as the Brook 
of Egypt. Esarhaddon invaded Egypt proper in Taharqa's 17th regnal year, after Esarhaddon had settled 
a revolt at Ashkelon. Taharqa defeated the Assyrians on that occasion, but three years later (671 BC) 
the Assyrian king captured and sacked Memphis, where he captured numerous members of the royal family. 
Taharqa fled to the south, and Esarhaddon reorganized the political scene in the north, establishing 
Necho I of the 26th dynasty as king at Sais. [PARAGRAPH:1]Upon the Assyrian king's departure, however, 
Taharqa intrigued in the affairs of Lower Egypt, and fanned numerous revolts. Esarhaddon died before 
he could return to Egypt, and it was left to his heir Assurbanipal to once again invade Egypt. Assurbanipal 
defeated Taharqa, who afterwards fled first to Thebes, then up the Nile into Nubia. After appointing 
Tantamani, the son of Shabaka, as his successor, he died in exile and was buried at El-Kurru.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Taharqa[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Nubian Pharaoh of Egypt[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 
c.710 BC - 664 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Taharqa was a Nubian pharaoh 
of Egypt. He was the last ruler of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, the so-called Ethiopian Dynasty, and was 
driven out of Lower Egypt by the Assyrians as they began to conquer Egypt. [PARAGRAPH:1]When Shabaka 
conquered Lower Egypt and thus asserted Nubian rule, he was accompanied by his nephew Taharqa, who was 
about age 20. Later, during Shabaka's reign as pharaoh, Egypt confronted the growing might of Assyria 
on the battlefield. Taharqa was at the head of the Egyptian army, but it is not clear whether the two 
forces actually fought. Taharqa's brother Shabataka succeeded Shabaka, and he made Taharqa his coregent 
in order to assure his succession. About 688 BC, approximately 23 years after Nubian rule had been imposed 
over Egypt, Taharqa assumed the throne in his own right. [PARAGRAPH:1]The next few years were peaceful, 
and Taharqa moved his capital to Tanis in the Delta so that he could stay well informed about events 
in the neighboring Asian countries. By 671 BC Egypt and Assyria again approached a confrontation, so 
Taharqa prepared to fight for the continued survival of Egypt. But the Assyrian king, Esarhaddon, crossed 
the Sinai Desert and defeated Taharqa's army on the frontier. In 2 weeks he was besieging Memphis. The 
Egyptian army crumbled under the attack of the better-disciplined Assyrian army, which was armed with 
iron weapons. [PARAGRAPH:1]Taharqa fled to Upper Egypt, leaving Esarhaddon to take control of Lower Egypt. 
Two years later Taharqa returned with a fresh army and managed to recover control of the Delta, but this 
success was short-lived, and Esarhaddon's successor, Ashurbanipal, drove Taharqa south again. After this 
final defeat he never again tried to campaign in the north. Egypt then entered into a long era of successive
