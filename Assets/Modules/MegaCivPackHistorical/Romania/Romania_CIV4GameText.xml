		<English>[TAB]Romanians trace their history back to 300 B.C. But Romania did not become an independent, unified country until 1861. During most of the time in-between, various foreign peoples ruled all or part of Romania.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the years from 300 to 200 B.C., Dacian people farmed, mined gold and iron ore, and traded with neighboring peoples.  Romania was called "Dacia" during this period. The Romans, under Emperor Trajan, conquered Dacia in A.D. 106, and made it a province of the Roman Empire. Roman soldiers occupied Dacia, and Roman colonists settled there. The Romans intermarried with the Dacians, who adopted Roman customs and the Latin language. Dacia became known as Romania because of the Roman occupation and influence.[PARAGRAPH:2]Barbarians from the east and north began invading Romania during the 2nd century A.D. They forced the Romans to abandon the province in the late 200's. The invasions were to continue off and on until the 1100's. The invaders included Bulgars, Goths, Huns, Magyars, Slavs, and Tartars. These groups, especially the Slavs, intermarried with the Romanians.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Romanian nobles made several attempts to gain freedom from the Ottoman Empire. As a result, in the early 1700s, the empire sent wealthy Greeks to govern the principalities. These Greeks were called Phanariots because they came from the Phanar district of Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey). They taxed the peasants far more than ever before and treated them harshly. Phanariot rule lasted until 1821, when a revolt by Romanians forced the Ottomans to remove the Greeks from power. Many scholars believe that Romania's peasants never suffered more than they did during the Phanariot period.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Russians took over next. During the late 1700s, the Ottoman Empire suffered a series of military defeats at the hands of Russia. Little by little, the Ottomans lost parts of their empire. Officially, Ottoman rule of the principalities lasted until 1878. But, in effect, it ended in 1829, when Russian troops occupied the principalities. Russia drew up a constitution for the principalities in the early 1830s. The constitution, called "Organic Statutes," gave governing power in each principality to an assembly of nobles. This marked the beginning of representative government in Romania. Russia's troops withdrew from the principalities in 1834. The idea of uniting Moldavia and Walachia existed almost from the time the principalities were founded. The unification movement grew rapidly during the mid-1800s. In 1859, the assemblies of the two principalities elected Prince Alexander John Cuza as their common ruler. In 1861, the principalities officially united to form a nation called Romania. In 1878, the major nations of Europe officially recognized Romania's full independence from Turkey. In 1881, Romania became a kingdom, and Carol became King Carol I.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the start of Carol's reign, Romania's first political parties were established, and the people were given the right to elect their government representatives. But a complex election system kept the peasants from having many representatives. Romania's economy improved under Carol. Wealthy Romanians benefited from the economic growth, but the peasants gained little from it. In 1907, Romania's peasants revolted. They burned the houses and destroyed the crops of many wealthy landowners. The Romanian Army put down the revolt, killing at least 10,000 peasants. Carol died in 1914, and his nephew Ferdinand became king.[PARAGRAPH:2]World War I was fought from 1914 to 1918. Romania remained neutral at first. But in 1916, it joined France, Great Britain, and the other Allies in their fight against the Central Powers (chiefly Austria-Hungary and Germany). Romania wanted to gain Banat, Bukovina, and Transylvania--three provinces of Austria-Hungary that had large Romanian populations. The Allies won the war, and Romania received the territories it wanted as part of the peace settlement. As a result, Romania about doubled in size and population. For the first time, Romania's territory included almost all the land where large numbers of Romanians lived.[PARAGRAPH:2]World War II ended in 1945, and the Allies took northern Transylvania from Hungary and returned it to Romania. The Soviet Union and Bulgaria kept the Romanian territory they had taken. The Communists declared Romania an "independent people's democracy." But Romania was a Soviet satellite (country controlled by the Soviet Union). In 1948 and 1952, Romania adopted constitutions that praised the Soviet Union. Romania's government, educational system, and other institutions were modeled on those of the Soviet Union. Soviet leaders directed Romania's economy and forced the country to emphasize agriculture and neglect industry. They also set foreign policy.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ceausescu's government maintained an extensive system of restrictions on the lives of the people. In mid-December 1989, thousands of people in the city of Timisoara staged demonstrations, calling for greater freedom from the Communist government and for an improved standard of living. Government security forces responded to the protests by firing on the people and killing hundreds. Antigovernment protests then spread across Romania. In Bucharest, tens of thousands gathered in the streets and called for increased freedoms and the resignation of Ceausescu. Security forces fired on the crowds, bringing the death toll of demonstrators into the thousands. Army units joined the revolt, and fierce fighting between the army and Ceausescu's security forces followed.[PARAGRAPH:2]On December 22, Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, fled Bucharest during a massive antigovernment demonstration. However, they were soon captured by the army. A secret trial took place and Ceausescu and his wife were charged with murder and embezzlement of government funds. They were found guilty and were executed on December 25. [PARAGRAPH:2]Much discussion is currently focused on the decision by Romania's government to join the European Union (EU). </English>

Phanariot rule lasted until 1821, when a revolt by Romanians forced the Ottomans to remove the Greeks from power. Many scholars believe that Romania's peasants never suffered more than they did during the Phanariot period.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Russians took over next. During the late 1700s, the Ottoman Empire suffered a series of military defeats at the hands of Russia. Little by little, the Ottomans lost parts of their empire. Officially, Ottoman rule of the principalities lasted until 1878. But, in effect, it ended in 1829, when Russian troops occupied the principalities. Russia drew up a constitution for the principalities in the early 1830s. The constitution, called "Organic Statutes," gave governing power in each principality to an assembly of nobles. This marked the beginning of representative government in Romania. Russia's troops withdrew from the principalities in 1834. The idea of uniting Moldavia and Walachia existed almost from the time the principalities were founded. The unification movement grew rapidly during the mid-1800s. In 1859, the assemblies of the two principalities elected Prince Alexander John Cuza as their common ruler. In 1861, the principalities officially united to form a nation called Romania. In 1878, the major nations of Europe officially recognized Romania's full independence from Turkey. In 1881, Romania became a kingdom, and Carol became King Carol I.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the start of Carol's reign, Romania's first political parties were established, and the people were given the right to elect their government representatives. But a complex election system kept the peasants from having many representatives. Romania's economy improved under Carol. Wealthy Romanians benefited from the economic growth, but the peasants gained little from it. In 1907, Romania's peasants revolted. They burned the houses and destroyed the crops of many wealthy landowners. The Romanian Army put down the revolt, killing at least 10,000 peasants. Carol died in 1914, and his nephew Ferdinand became king.[PARAGRAPH:2]World War I was fought from 1914 to 1918. Romania remained neutral at first. But in 1916, it joined France, Great Britain, and the other Allies in their fight against the Central Powers (chiefly Austria-Hungary and Germany). Romania wanted to gain Banat, Bukovina, and Transylvania--three provinces of Austria-Hungary that had large Romanian populations. The Allies won the war, and Romania received the territories it wanted as part of the peace settlement. As a result, Romania about doubled in size and population. For the first time, Romania's territory included almost all the land where large numbers of Romanians lived.[PARAGRAPH:2]World War II ended in 1945, and the Allies took northern Transylvania from Hungary and returned it to Romania. The Soviet Union and Bulgaria kept the Romanian territory they had taken. The Communists declared Romania an "independent people's democracy." But Romania was a Soviet satellite (country controlled by the Soviet Union). In 1948 and 1952, Romania adopted constitutions that praised the Soviet Union. Romania's government, educational system, and other institutions were modeled on those of the Soviet Union. Soviet leaders directed Romania's economy and forced the country to emphasize agriculture and neglect industry. They also set foreign policy.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ceausescu's government maintained an extensive system of restrictions on the lives of the people. In mid-December 1989, thousands of people in the city of Timisoara staged demonstrations, calling for greater freedom from the Communist government and for an improved standard of living. Government security forces responded to the protests by firing on the people and killing hundreds. Antigovernment protests then spread across Romania. In Bucharest, tens of thousands gathered in the streets and called for increased freedoms and the resignation of Ceausescu. Security forces fired on the crowds, bringing the death toll of demonstrators into the thousands. Army units joined the revolt, and fierce fighting between the army and Ceausescu's security forces followed.[PARAGRAPH:2]On December 22, Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, fled Bucharest during a massive antigovernment demonstration. However, they were soon captured by the army. A secret trial took place and Ceausescu and his wife were charged with murder and embezzlement of government funds. They were found guilty and were executed on December 25. [PARAGRAPH:2]Much discussion is currently focused on the decision by Romania's government to join the European Union (EU). </Russian>
		
		<Chinese>[TAB]Romanians trace their history back to 300 B.C. But Romania did not become an independent, unified country until 1861. During most of the time in-between, various foreign peoples ruled all or part of Romania.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the years from 300 to 200 B.C., Dacian people farmed, mined gold and iron ore, and traded with neighboring peoples.  Romania was called "Dacia" during this period. The Romans, under Emperor Trajan, conquered Dacia in A.D. 106, and made it a province of the Roman Empire. Roman soldiers occupied Dacia, and Roman colonists settled there. The Romans intermarried with the Dacians, who adopted Roman customs and the Latin language. Dacia became known as Romania because of the Roman occupation and influence.[PARAGRAPH:2]Barbarians from the east and north began invading Romania during the 2nd century A.D. They forced the Romans to abandon the province in the late 200's. The invasions were to continue off and on until the 1100's. The invaders included Bulgars, Goths, Huns, Magyars, Slavs, and Tartars. These groups, especially the Slavs, intermarried with the Romanians.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Romanian nobles made several attempts to gain freedom from the Ottoman Empire. As a result, in the early 1700s, the empire sent wealthy Greeks to govern the principalities.

       	<English>[H1]Alexandru Ioan Cuza[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ruler of the Romanian Kingdom[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1820 - 1973[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Alexandru Cuza belonged to the traditional noble (boier) class, the Orthodox Christian Romanian upper class that had come into control of the local governments of Wallachia and Moldavia, and retained traditional control of the country's land, the only key to pre-industrial wealth. Cuza received an urbane European education.  In 1848, the year of the European Revolutions, Moldovia and Wallachia fell into revolt.  In Moldavia the unrest was quickly suppressed, but in Wallachia the revolutionaries took power and governed during the summer. Young Cuza played a prominent enough part to establish his liberal credentials (compared to most nobility) and to be shipped to Vienna as a prisoner, where he soon made his escape.[NEWLINE][TAB]Afterwards however, following a brief career in the Moldavian army, he became minister of war in 1858, and represented Galati in the assembly at Iasi, acting under the guarantee of the European Powers in the wake of the Crimean war to nominate a prince for Moldavia. Cuza was a prominent speaker in the debates and strongly advocated the union of the two Danubian principalities, Moldavia and Walachia. In default of a foreign prince, he was himself elected prince of Moldavia (Moldova) on January 17, 1859 (January 5, Julian) and of Wallachia (Tara Rom\E2neasca) on February 5, 1859.[NEWLINE][TAB]Thus Colonel A. I. Cuza achieved a de facto union of the two Romanian principalites. The Powers backtracked, Napoleon III of France remaining supportive, while the Austro-Hungarian ministry withheld approval of such a union at the Congress of Paris (October 18, 1858); partly as a consequence Cuza's authority was not recognized by his nominal suzerain, the sultan of Turkey, until the December 23, 1861.[NEWLINE]The Union was formally declared three years later, on February 5, 1862 (January 24, Julian), the new country bearing the name of Romania, with Bucharest as its capital city.[NEWLINE][TAB]Cuza was not a diplomatic politician, and lacked the traditional royal background, but he knew how to choose progressive ministers and had an intelligent ear for advice. Immediately he gained the sultan's assent to a single unified parliament and cabinet for his lifetime, in recognition of the complexity of the task. Thus he was the political embodiment of a unified Romania, for his lifetime.[NEWLINE][TAB]Assisted by his councilor Mihail Kogalniceanu, an intellectual leader of the 1848 revolution, Cuza initiated a series of reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures.The drastic reforms which he imposed to bring Romania fully into the 19th century impinged upon all classes and alienated his more influential subjects.[NEWLINE][TAB]Cuza failed in his effort to create an alliance of prosperous peasants and a strong liberal prince, ruling as a benevolent despot in the style of Napoleon III. Financial distress supervened, there was an awkward scandal that revolved around his mistress, and popular discontent culminated in revolution. Cuza was forced to abdicate by the so-called "Monstrous Coalition" of conservatives and radical liberals. At four o'clock on the morning of February 22, 1866, a group of military conspirators broke into the palace, and compelled the prince to sign his abdication. On the following day they conducted him safely across the frontier.Cuza spent the remainder of his life in exile, chiefly in Paris, Vienna and Wiesbaden. He died at Heidelberg on May 15, 1873.</English>
