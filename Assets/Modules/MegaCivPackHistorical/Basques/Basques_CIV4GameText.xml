		<English>[TAB]The Basque Country (Basque: Euskal Herria) is the name given to the home of the Basque 
people in the western Pyrenees that spans the border between France and Spain on the Atlantic coast. 
It is the oldest documented Basque name for the area they inhabit, dating to the 16th century and thus 
predates the emergence of Basque nationalism by at least two centuries. It comprises the Autonomous Communities 
of the Basque Country and Navarre in Spain and the Northern Basque Country in France. Even though they 
are not necessarily synonyms, the concept of a single culturally Basque area spanning various regions 
and countries has been closely associated with the politics of Basque nationalism. The region is home 
to the Basque people (Basque: Euskaldunak), their language (Basque: Euskara), culture and traditions. 
The area is neither linguistically nor culturally homogeneous, and certain areas have a majority of people 
who do not consider themselves Basque, such as the south of Navarre where in 1996 the census reported 
that 71% of inhabitants did not identify themselves as Basque - although fewer people in the same area 
(53%) opposed measures to support the Basque language.</English>
