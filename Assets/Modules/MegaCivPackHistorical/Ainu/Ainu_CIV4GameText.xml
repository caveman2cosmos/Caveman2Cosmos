		<English>[TAB]The Ainu people have a legend that says, "The Ainu lived in this place a hundred thousand years before the Children of the Sun came". The prevailing mythology in Japan has been of the Ainu as a race of "noble savages," a proud but reclusive culture of hunter-gatherers. This mythology became a useful defense for the Japanese expropriation of Ainu lands. In fact, the Ainu were also farmers as well as hunter-gatherers from the earliest centuries of the Common Era.[PARAGRAPH:2]Human migration patterns show a population expansion from the area of the Sea of Japan towards the rest of eastern Asia and the American continent. [PARAGRAPH:2]As Japanese citizens, the Ainu are now governed by Japanese laws and judged by Japanese tribunals, but in the past, their affairs were administered by hereditary chiefs, three in each village, and for administrative purposes the country was divided into three districts, Saru, Usu and Ishikari, which were under the ultimate control of Saru, though the relations between their respective inhabitants were not close and intermarriages were avoided. The functions of judge were not entrusted to these chiefs; an indefinite number of a community's members sat in judgement upon its criminals. Capital punishment did not exist, nor did the community resort to imprisonment. Beating was considered a sufficient and final penalty. However, in the case of murder, the nose and ears of the culprit were cut off or the tendons of his feet severed. Intermarriages between Japanese and Ainu are not infrequent, and at Sambutsu especially, on the eastern coast, many children of such marriages may be seen.[PARAGRAPH:2]For historical reasons (primarily the Russo-Japanese War), nearly all Ainu live in Japan. There is, however, a small number of Ainu living on Sakhalin, most of them descendants of Sakhalin Ainu who were evicted and later returned. There is also an Ainu minority living at the southernmost area of the Kamchatka Peninsula and on the Kurile Islands. However, the only Ainu speakers remaining (besides perhaps a few partial speakers) live solely in Japan. There, they are concentrated primarily on the southern and eastern coasts of the island of Hokkaido.</English>

It was led by Chieftain of the Ainu Shakushain against the Matsumae clan, who represented Japanese trading and governmental interests in the area of Hokkaido then known as Wajin. The war was a final attempt by the Ainu to preserve their political independence and regain control over the terms of their trade relations with the Wajin. According to scholar Brett Walker:[PARAGRAPH:1] Shakushain's War stands out as a watershed event in the history of the conquest of Ezo. Shakushain exploded onto the scene as a charismatic leader who proved able to bridge regional differences among Ainu communities, threatening to unite them against the Japanese intrusion from the south. The Edo shogunate reacted by solidifying its own united from of military allies in the northeast, replacing local Matsumae generals with men of its own choosing, thus illustrating its self-appointed role as defender of the realm.[PARAGRAPH:1]The only other comparable large-scale revolt by Ainu against Japanese rule was the Menashi-Kunashir Battle of 1789.
