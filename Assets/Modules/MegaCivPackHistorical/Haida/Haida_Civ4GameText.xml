		<English>[TAB]The Haida are an Indigenous nation of the Northwest Coast of North America. The Haida territories comprise the archipelago of the Queen Charlotte Islands, known in the Haida language as Haida Gwaii ("land of the Haida") and the southern half of Prince of Wales Island in the southernmost Alaska Panhandle, which is the home of a subgroup called the Kaigani Haida.[PARAGRAPH:2]The term "Haida Nation" can and does refer to both the people and their government on Canadian territory, the Council of the Haida Nation; the government for those in Alaska is the Central Council Tlingit Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska. Their ancestral language is the Haida language, which has never been adequately classified by linguists because of its uniqueness. In addition to those Haida residing in the Queen Charlottes and Alaska, there are also many Haidas in various urban areas in the western United States and Canada. Haida society continues to be much engaged in the production of a robust and highly stylized art form. While frequently expressed in large wooden carvings totem poles or ornate jewellery it is also moving quickly into the work of populist expression such as Haida manga.[PARAGRAPH:2]Haidas were traditionally known as ruthless warriors and slave traders, raiding as far as California. Haida oral narratives record journeys as far north as the Bering Sea, and one account implies that even Asia was visited by Haidas before Europeans entered the Pacific. The Haida's ability to travel was dependent upon a supply of Western Red cedar trees that were carved and shaped into their famous Pacific Northwest Canoes. Carved from a single red cedar tree, a vessel could sleep 15 adults head to toe, and was propelled by up to 60 paddlers (who often included women). In the event of a battle at sea, paddlers were armed with heavy stone rings (18 to 23 kg) attached to woven tree root or bark ropes. These devices, are thrown at enemy canoes, inflicting substantial damage. Haida warriors entered battle with red cedar armor, wooden shields, stone maces and spear-throwers. War helmets were carved. These techniques are unknown to anyone other than the Haida people as they have kept it secret for many years. It is still unknown how the Haida would carve their war helmets and how they looked.[PARAGRAPH:2]Even prehistorically, the Haida engaged in sea battles.They tied cedar bark ropes to heavy stone rings that were hurled to smash enemy canoes and that could quickly be retrieved for subsequent throws. A stone weighing 18 to 23 kg (40 to 50 pounds) could shatter the side of a dugout canoe and cause it to founder. Most tribes avoided sea battles with the Haida and tried to lure them ashore for a more equitable fight. The Tsimshian developed a signal-fire system to alert their villages on the Skeena River as soon as Haida invaders reached the mainland. Fortified sites were part of the defensive strategy of all Northwest Coast groups for at least 2,000 years. Captain James Cook was so impressed with one Haida fort off the west coast of Graham Island that he called it Hippah Island after the Maori forts he had seen in New Zealand. Military defences at Haida forts included stout palisades, rolling top-log defences, heavy trapdoors and fighting platforms supplied with stores of large boulders to hurl at invaders.</English>

Currently a town in British Columbia, Skidegate is named after the chief of the village in the early 1800s, as was customary at the time. The first contact between Europeans and the people of Skidegate appears to have been made by Captain George Dixon, who in July 1787 anchored off the entrance to Skidegate Inlet. He did not visit the village but does provide the first description of Chief Skidegate: [PARAGRAPH:1]"Of all the Indians we had seen, this chief had the most savage aspect, and his whole appearance sufficiently marked him as a proper person to lead a tribe of cannibals. His stature was above the common size; his body spare and thin, and though at first sight he appeared lank and emaciated, yet his step was bold and firm, and his limbs apparently strong and muscular. "[PARAGRAPH:1]Within a few years of Dixon's visit, many ships from Europe and New England included Skidegate in their itinerary while pursuing the lucrative trade in sea otter pelts. The name of the town chief was, as usual, applied by the traders to the community itself. Skidegate in Haida means "son of the chiton". One of the best observers is Joseph Ingraham of the brigantine Hope out of Boston, who recorded his first meeting in 1791 with the town chief of Skidegate in his journal: [PARAGRAPH:1]"At 10 o'clock in the evening a small canoe was seen coming to us in which was 4 men as she was so small I let them come alongside they said they were of the tribe of Skeetkiss and had furr for sale they sold us but one skin when they could better examine our articles of trade as the least flaw in our chizzles or daggers was sufficient to condemn them as unfit for their purpose... Towards night a large war canoe came into the bay and after holding a conversation with some other canoes (perhaps relative to the trade) they came alongside in this canoe was Skeetkiss a chief of the first consequence among these people as at every place we visited they spoke of him as a man of great power and of whom they were afraid. "[PARAGRAPH:1]During the 1830s, whalers began to arrive. In 1832, one whaling captain, a Mr. C. Jefferson, married a daughter of Chief Skidegate the Great and built a residence called Mosquito Hawk House. James Deans describes Skidegate the Great: [PARAGRAPH:1]"He was named the Great because he was large in body and wealth, if not in good deeds... He was a man about six feet in height, had a very small head on an exceedingly large body, so large that a belt he wore round his waist could go around three ordinary sized men. He was the richest chief of his day. It is said he had thirty slaves, male and female. He also had all the neighbouring tribes under his tribute." [PARAGRAPH:1]During the late 1800s, the Haida population in the traditional Haida villages declined dramatically as a result of smallpox epidemics and other European illnesses, against which the aboriginals had no immunity. The surviving Haida abandoned their ancient villages and regrouped in communities in Skidegate Mission and Masset.</English>

"[PARAGRAPH:1]Within a few years of Dixon's visit, many ships from Europe and New England included Skidegate in their itinerary while pursuing the lucrative trade in sea otter pelts. The name of the town chief was, as usual, applied by the traders to the community itself. Skidegate in Haida means "son of the chiton". One of the best observers is Joseph Ingraham of the brigantine Hope out of Boston, who recorded his first meeting in 1791 with the town chief of Skidegate in his journal: [PARAGRAPH:1]"At 10 o'clock in the evening a small canoe was seen coming to us in which was 4 men as she was so small I let them come alongside they said they were of the tribe of Skeetkiss and had furr for sale they sold us but one skin when they could better examine our articles of trade as the least flaw in our chizzles or daggers was sufficient to condemn them as unfit for their purpose... Towards night a large war canoe came into the bay and after holding a conversation with some other canoes (perhaps relative to the trade) they came alongside in this canoe was Skeetkiss a chief of the first consequence among these people as at every place we visited they spoke of him as a man of great power and of whom they were afraid. "[PARAGRAPH:1]During the 1830s, whalers began to arrive. In 1832, one whaling captain, a Mr. C. Jefferson, married a daughter of Chief Skidegate the Great and built a residence called Mosquito Hawk House. James Deans describes Skidegate the Great: [PARAGRAPH:1]"He was named the Great because he was large in body and wealth, if not in good deeds... He was a man about six feet in height, had a very small head on an exceedingly large body, so large that a belt he wore round his waist could go around three ordinary sized men. He was the richest chief of his day. It is said he had thirty slaves, male and female. He also had all the neighbouring tribes under his tribute." [PARAGRAPH:1]During the late 1800s, the Haida population in the traditional Haida villages declined dramatically as a result of smallpox epidemics and other European illnesses, against which the aboriginals had no immunity. The surviving Haida abandoned their ancient villages and regrouped in communities in Skidegate Mission and Masset.</Spanish>
