		<English>[BOLD]Strategy:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]The Indonesians is not a, but THE jackal of all trades, 
with Suhartos "Financial" and "Industrious" traits making economy and production a no-brainer and Hayam 
Wuruks "Imperialistic" and "Aggressive" which allows for empire building in a rather fast speed. At the 
same time the free Happiness and Culture boost from their [COLOR_BUILDING_TEXT]Candi[COLOR_REVERT] UB 
grants them easy extendable borders while their UU [COLOR_UNIT_TEXT]Pencak Silat[COLOR_REVERT] strikes 
down with the increased Strength of a real martial-arts figher.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]The 
Indonesian archipelago was reached by the Modern Man in 45.000 BC. A migration from Southeast asia around 
2000 BC brought many new techniques, and in the 8th century BC, the Indonesian people mastered bronze 
casting, wet-field rice cultivation, megalithik practises and much more. This allowed villages, towns 
and small kingdoms to flourish by the 1st century AD. With the introduction of Buddhism and Hinduism 
came great monuments, and both the Saleindra and Medang kingdoms built large Hindu and Buddhist stupas 
commonly called Candis, including the large Borobudut and Prambanan. In the 7th century however, this 
small kingdom society were soon to come to an end with the rise of Sri Vijaya.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Sri Vijaya 
was a Malay kingdom formed on the island of Sumatra that flourished on its trade and naval power. While 
not a state in modern sense, it was rather a confederacy form of society centered on the royal heartland 
and trading centre of Palembang. Especially the trade trought the Starit of Malacca gained the country 
financial advantages, and by the end of the 7th century Sri Vijaya controlled numerous trade cities along 
both sides of the strait. Controlling both the Malacca and Sunda straits, they lived on as a formidable 
economy and naval power well into the 13th century, and their reign saw the height of the Buddhist influence 
in Indonesia.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]The decline of Sri Vijaya in the 13th century left many of the Islands with 
regional kingdoms, and when the kingdom of Singhasari emerged on Java, Kublai Khan sent emmisaries to 
demand tribute. The Majapahit kingdom, an original ally of Singhasari and also based on Java, allied 
with the mongols and defeated the Singhasari, but then turned against them and forced the mongol forces 
to withdraw in confusion. This marked the beginning of the second large Indonesian empire, the Majapahit. 
Majapahit reached its peak under Hayam Wuruk and his prime minister and commander Gajah Mada, and just 
a few years after Gajah Madas death, Hayam Wuruk conquered Palembang and ended Sri Vijaya rule in Indonesia. 
Although the Majapahit rulers extended their power over other islands and destroyed neighbouring kingdoms, 
their focus seems to have been on controlling and gaining a larger share of the commercial trade that 
passed through the archipelago. About the time Majapahit was founded, Muslim traders and proselytisers  
began entering the area.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]After Majahapits peak in the 14th century, Majapahit power began 
to decline and was unable to control the rising power of the Sultanate of Malacca. With an increased 
percantage of the population converting to Islam, the islands saw mostly muslim rule for the next centuries, 
with numerous different sultanates controlling the Islands.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]In the 16th century, sucsessful 
european invasions put the Sultanates to an end, with the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and British seeking 
to dominate the Spice trade from India and the 'Spice Islands' of Indonesia. In the early 16 century, 
the Portuguese manged to control the trade, but in 1602 the Dutch parliament awarded the Dutch East-India 
Company with a monoploy on all trade and colonial activities in Indonesia at a time before the company 
controlled any territory in there. In the early 20th century, the monopoly was compleated and the boundaries 
of modern Indonesia was created. It was also in this period that the first Indoneasian national movement 
started, basing their idea of one Indonesian nation on Sri Vijaya and Majapahit.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]During 
World War II, Japan extended their Pacific empire to far away lands, including Indonesia. With the Dutch 
losing control of the archipelago, Indonesia decleared independance 2 days after Japans defeat and the 
and of the war. This marked the beginning if modern day Indonesia, and the first president, Sukarno, 
was elected. He introduced a form of democracy he called the 'Old Order', claiming that western democracy 
would not work in Indonesia. Although his methods worked in the beginning, he relied more and more on 
support from the Indonesian communist party, the PKI, which was the largest communist party outside of 
China and Soviet. With the party gaining more and more power, the militarya and the islamic groups, the 
other two major powers in Indonesia, got worried, and with the army did everything they could to weaken 
Sukarno. In March 1967, Sukarno were forced to abdicate and the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly 
named the army general Suharto as Acting President.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Suharto brought many changes with him 
during his "New Order", which he named his goverment to differ it from Sukartos "Old Order", and early 
in his reign he invaded Papua after negotiations with the Dutch about the territory faied. The invasion 
was however easily repelled, and Suharto then gave them the "Act of Free Choice". After learning the 
Papuan representaions Indonesia, they were threatened and bribed to vote in Indonesias favor, and the 
transfer were confirmed by a UN General Assembly meeting. During his period he also transmigrated peole 
from the overpopluated areas to the more underpopulated islands, stating that this was for the good of 
the economy and industry and to give the poor a chance and he annexed the earlier Portuguese region East-Timor. 
During his reign Indonesia also became of OPEC, short for Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, 
due to large amounts of oil found in the area, something that helped Indonesias wealth, even when corruption 
was pretty usual during his reign.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Within a few years, however, many of its original allies 
had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a 
narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro-democracy movement which forced Suharto to resign in the 
Indonesian 1998 Revolution and then gained power, the term "New Order" has come to be used pejoratively.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Indonesia 
today is a country with much history. It granted independence to East-Timor in 2002, and its economy 
is growing. In 2004 a massive earthquake and tsunami devasted parts of Northern Sumatra, particulary 
the Aceh region. The same year Susilo Bambang won the first direct presidental election, and he was re-elected 
in 2009 to a second term. This shows that Indoneasia is on its way into a stable and democratic country, 
and the possiblity for them raising again as a power in Southeast Asia is still there.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>

		<English>[H1]Hayam Wuruk[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Majapahit[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1334 
to 1389 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Born as the fourth monarch of Majapahit, 
he is credited as a bright, talendted, handsome and exceptional in the courtly martial arts. He was educeted 
with the purpose of being the next Majapahit king and his reign marked the peak of Majapahit glory.[PARAGRAPH:1]When 
Rajapatni, Hayams grandmother, died in 1350, Tribhuwana, Hayams mum and queen of Majapahit, had to descend 
from the throne because she ruled Majapahit under Rajapatni's auspices, and she must relinquish her throne 
to her son. He inherited the throne at an age of 16, at the same time as his Prime Minister, Gajah Mada, 
was at the height of his career. With the help of Gajah Mada, Hayam extended his rule all trough the 
Indonesian archipelago.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1357, Hayam was to marry the princess of the Sunda kingdom. The 
reasons of this royal engagement was probably a political one, to foster alliance between Majapahit and 
the Sundanese Kingdom. However in the Bubat incident, the Sunda royal family and their guards was involved 
in skirmish with Majapahit troops. The planned royal wedding ended in disaster with the death of the 
princess and the whole of Sunda royal party. The court officials blamed Gajah Mada, because it was his 
intention to demand submission from Sunda Kingdom that ended in bloodshed.[PARAGRAPH:1]Several years 
later, Hayam wed his cousin, Sori, and they had a daughter who later married to a relative, Wikramawardhana, 
who then became the Crown Prince. However Hayam also had a son, Wirabhumi, with the royal concubine, 
and after Hayams death in 1389, Wirabhumi tried to seize the throne from Wikramawardhana. Although Wikramawardhana 
crushed the rebellion in the end, is severly weakeden Majapahit and this can be seen as the start of 
its decline.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>

		<English>[H1]Haji Mohammed Suharto[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Indonesia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: 
[\BOLD] 1921 - 2008 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Haji Mohammad Soeharto, 
more commonly referred to as simply Soeharto (General Suharto in the English-speaking world), is a former 
Indonesian military and political leader. He served as a military officer in the Indonesian National 
Revolution, but is better known as the long-reigning second President of Indonesia, holding the office 
from 1967 to 1998.[PARAGRAPH:1]Suharto seized power from his predecessor, the first president of Indonesia 
Sukarno, through a mixture of force and political maneuvering against the backdrop of foreign and domestic 
unrest. Over the three decades of his "New Order" regime, Suharto constructed a strong central government 
along militarist lines. An ability to maintain stability and an avowedly anti-Communist stance won him 
the economic and diplomatic patronage of several Western governments in the era of the Cold War. For 
almost all of his three-decade rule, Indonesia experienced rapid industrialization and economic growth.[PARAGRAPH:1]The 
Suharto regime had won the favour of Western governments and institutions, however, in 1990's, its increasingly 
authoritarian and corrupt practices became a source of much discontent. After the 1990s brought end of 
the Cold War, Western concern over communism waned, and Suharto's human rights record came under greater 
international scrutiny. In 1991, the murder of East Timorese civilians in a Dili cemetery, also known 
as the "Santa Cruz Massacre", caused American attention to focus on its military relations with the Suharto 
regime and the question of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor. In 1992,this attention resulted in the 
Congress of the United States passing limitations on IMET assistance to the Indonesian military, over 
the objections of President George H.W. Bush. In 1993, under President Bill Clinton, the U.S. delegation 
to the UN Human Rights Commission helped pass a resolution expressing deep concern over Indonesian human 
rights violations in East Timor. The Indonesian invasion and occupation of East Timor has been called 
the worst instance of genocide (relative to population) since the Holocaust.[PARAGRAPH:1]His almost unquestioned 
authority over Indonesian affairs slipped dramatically when the Asian financial crisis lowered Indonesians' 
standard of living and fractured his support among the nation's military, political and civil society 
institutions. After internal unrest and diplomatic isolation sapped his support in the mid-to-late 1990s, 
Suharto was forced to resign from the presidency in May 1998.[PARAGRAPH:1]After serving as the public 
face of Indonesia for over 30 years, Suharto then lived his post-presidential years in virtual seclusion. 
His legacy remains hotly debated and contested both in Indonesia and in foreign-policy debates in the 
West. Since his resignation, Suharto retired to a family compound in Central Jakarta, making few public 
appearances. Efforts to prosecute Suharto have mostly centered around alleged mismanagement of funds, 
and their force has been blunted due to health concerns. In january 2008, Suharto was taken to the Pertamina 
hospital, Jakarta, with complications arising from a weak heart, swelling of limbs and stomach, and partial 
renal failure. He died there at 27th of January at 1:10 pm.</English>
