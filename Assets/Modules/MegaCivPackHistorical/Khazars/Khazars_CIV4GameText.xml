		<English>[TAB]The Khazars were a semi-nomadic Turkic people who created what for its duration was the 
most powerful polity to emerge from the breakup of the western Turkish steppe empire, known as the Khazar 
Khanate or Khazaria. Astride a major artery of commerce between northern Europe and southwestern Asia, 
Khazaria became one of the foremost trading emporia of the medieval world, commanding the western marches 
of the Silk Road and played a key commercial role as a crossroad between China, the Middle East, and 
Kievan Rus'. For some three centuries (c. 650–965) the Khazars dominated the vast area extending from 
the Volga-Don steppes to the eastern Crimea and the northern Caucasus. Khazaria long served as a buffer 
state between the Byzantine empire and both the nomads of the northern steppes and the Umayyad empire, 
after serving as Byzantium's proxy against the Sasanian Persian empire. The alliance was dropped around 
900. Byzantium began to encourage the Alans to attack Khazaria and weaken its hold on Crimea and the 
Caucasus, while seeking to obtain an entente with the rising Rus' power to the north, which it aspired 
to convert to Christianity. Between 965 and 969, the Kievan Rus ruler Sviatoslav I of Kiev conquered 
the capital Atil and destroyed the Khazar state. Beginning in the 8th century, Khazar royalty and notable 
segments of the aristocracy converted to Judaism; the populace appears to have been multi-confessional—a 
mosaic of pagan, Tengrist, Jewish, Christian and Muslim worshippers—and polyethnic. Khazar origins for, 
or suggestions Khazars were absorbed by many peoples, have been made regarding the Slavic Judaising Subbotniks, 
the Bukharan Jews, the Muslim Kumyks, Kazakhs, Nogais,[citation needed] the Cossacks of the Don region, 
the Turkic-speaking Krymchaks and the and their Crimean neighbours the Karaites to the Moldavian Csángós, 
the Mountain Jews and others. A modern theory, that the core of Ashkenazi Jewry emerged from a hypothetical 
Khazarian Jewish diaspora, is now viewed with scepticism by most scholars, but occasionally supported 
by others. This Khazarian hypothesis is sometimes associated with antisemitism and anti-Zionism.</English>

was a Khazar king who led the conversion of the Khazars to Judaism. His name means "elk" in Old Turkic. 
In modern Turkish, it means The one who finds (Bul + an). The date of his reign is unknown, as the date 
of the conversion is hotly disputed, though it is certain that Bulan reigned some time between the mid-700s 
and the mid-800s. Nor is it settled whether Bulan was the Bek or the Khagan of the Khazars. D. M. Dunlop 
was certain that Bulan was a Khagan; however, more recent works, such as The Jews of Khazaria by Kevin 
Brook, assume that he was the Bek due to references to him leading military campaigns. Khazar tradition 
held that before his own conversion, Bulan was religiously unaffiliated. In his quest to discover which 
of the three Abrahamic religions would shape his own religious beliefs, he invited representatives from 
each to explain their fundamental tenets. In the end, he chose Judaism. In the Khazar Correspondence, 
King Joseph traces his lineage back to Bulan. He refers to the reforming Khazar ruler Obadiah as being 
one of "the sons of the sons of Bulan". While Brook assumes this makes Obadiah Bulan's grandson, the 
Hebrew phrase is less definitive and may allude to a more remote descent. The royal descendants of Bulan 
are referred to by Khazar researchers as Bulanids, though their self-designation is unknown. The name 
Sabriel is given in the Schechter Letter (roughly contemporaneous with King Joseph's letter) for the 
Khazar king who led the conversion to Judaism. The Schechter Letter also gives Sabriel at least a partial 
Jewish/Israelite ancestry. Sabriel is described as having waged successful campaigns in the Caucasus 
and Iranian Azerbaijan, possibly as part of the Khazar-Arab wars. His wife, Serakh, is described as a 
Jew and as encouraging him to study and adopt Judaism. The Schechter Letter is silent on the issue of 
whether Sabriel was Bulan; the name Bulan does not appear in that document. Khazar scholars sometimes 
refer to the king who led the Khazar conversion to Judaism as "Bulan Sabriel", though it is conceivable 
that they may have been different people. In The History of the Jewish Khazars, for instance, D. M. Dunlop 
examined (and ultimately rejected) the theory of other scholars that Sabriel referred to Obadiah.</English>
