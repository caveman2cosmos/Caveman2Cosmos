		<English>[H1]Skanderbeg[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Tsar of Albania[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1405 - 1468 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]George Kastrioti, commonly known as Skanderbeg, was a 15th-century Albanian nobleman.[D] Skanderbeg was born in 1405[G] to the noble Kastrioti family. Sultan Murad II took him hostage in 1423 and he served the Ottoman Empire during the next twenty years. He was appointed as sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Dibra by the Ottomans in 1440. In 1443, he deserted the Ottomans during the Battle of Niš and became the ruler of Krujë, Svetigrad, and Modrič. In 1444, he was appointed as a commander of the short-lived League of Lezhë, which proclaimed him Chief of the League of the Albanian people and defended the region of Albania against the Ottoman Empire for 25 years.[1] Skanderbeg was not able to do more than to hold his own possessions within the very small area in the North Albania where almost all his victories against the Ottomans took place.[2] Skanderbeg's rebellion was not a general uprising of Albanians, due to the fact that he did not gain support in the Ottoman-controlled south of Albania or Venetian-controlled north of Albania. His followers, along with Albanians, included Slavs, Vlachs, and Greeks. In 1451, he recognized de jure the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Naples through the Treaty of Gaeta, to ensure a protective alliance, although he remained a de facto independent ruler.[4] In 1460–1461, he participated in Italy's civil wars in support of Ferdinand I of Naples. In 1463, he became the chief commander of the crusading forces of Pope Pius II, but the Pope died while the armies were still gathering. Together with Venetians he fought against the Ottomans during the Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–79) until his death in January 1468. Skanderbeg's military skills presented a major obstacle to Ottoman expansion, and he was considered by many in western Europe to be a model of Christian resistance against the Ottoman Muslims. Skanderbeg is Albania's most important national hero and a key figure of the Albanian National Awakening.</English>
