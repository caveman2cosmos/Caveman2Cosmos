		<English>[H1]Obasanjo[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]12th President of Nigeria[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 
1937 - [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]General (rtd.) Chief Olusegun Aremu 
Okikiola Matthew Obasanjo,(born circa March 5, 1937) is a retired Nigerian Army General and former President 
of Nigeria. A Christian of Yoruba descent, Obasanjo was a career soldier before serving twice as his 
nation's head of state, once as a military ruler and again as elected President. The military regimes 
of Murtala Muhammad and Obasanjo benefited from a tremendous influx of oil revenue that increased 350 
percent between 1973 and 1974, when oil prices skyrocketed, to 1979, when the military stepped down. 
Increased revenues permitted massive spending; this spending, however, was poorly planned and concentrated 
in urban areas. The oil boom was marred by a minor recession in 1978-79, but revenues rebounded until 
mid-1981. The increase in revenues made possible a rapid rise in income, especially for the urban middle 
class. There was a corresponding inflation, particularly in the price of food, that promoted both industrialisation 
and the expansion of agricultural production. As a result of the shift to food crops, the traditional 
export earners - peanuts, cotton, cocoa, and palm products - declined in significance and then ceased 
to be important at all. Nigeria's exports became dominated by oil.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the dictatorship 
of Sani Abacha (1993 - 1998), Obasanjo spoke out against the human rights abuses of the regime, and was 
imprisoned with the claim of planning a coup. He was released only after Abacha's sudden death on 8 June 
1998. It was after his release from prison that Obasanjo announced that he was a born-again Christian. 
In the 1999 elections, the first in sixteen years, he decided to run for the presidency as the candidate 
of the People's Democratic Party. Obasanjo won with 62.6% of the vote, sweeping the strongly Christian 
Southeast and the predominantly Muslim north, but decisively lost his home region, the Southwest, to 
his fellow-Yoruba and Christian, Olu Falae, the only other candidate. It is thought that lingering resentment 
among his fellow-Yorubas about his previous military administration of 1976 to 1979, after which he handed 
power over to a government dominated by northerners rather than by Yorubas, contributed to his poor showing 
among his own people. May 29, the day Obasanjo took office as the first elected and civilian head of 
state in Nigeria after 16 years of military rule, is now commemorated as Democracy Day, a public holiday 
in Nigeria.[PARAGRAPH:1]Obasanjo was re-elected in 2003 in a tumultuous election that had violent ethnic 
and religious overtones, his main opponent (fellow former military ruler General Muhammadu Buhari) being 
a Muslim who drew his support mainly from the north. Capturing 61.8% of the vote, Obasanjo defeated Buhari 
by more than 11 million votes. In 2005 the international community gave Nigeria's government its first 
pass mark for its anti-corruption efforts. However, a growing number of critics within Nigeria have accused 
Obasanjo's government of selectively targeting his anti-corruption drive against political opponents 
and ethnic militants, ignoring growing concerns about wide-scale corruption within his own inner political 
circle.</English>
