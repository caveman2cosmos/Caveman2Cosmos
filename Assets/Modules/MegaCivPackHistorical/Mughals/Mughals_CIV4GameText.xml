		<English>[TAB]The Mughal Empire was an Indian-Islamic imperial power that ruled a large portion of 
the Indian subcontinent which began in 1526, invaded and ruled most of South Asia by the late 17th and 
early 18th centuries by forming alliance with Indian Maharaja, and ended in the mid-19th century. The 
Mughal Emperors were descendants of the Timurids, and at the height of their power around 1700, they 
controlled most of the Indian Subcontinent extending from Bengal in the east to Balochistan in the west, 
Kashmir in the north to the Kaveri basin in the south. Its population at that time has been estimated 
as between 110 and 130 million, over a territory of over 4 million sq.km (1.5 million square miles).[PARAGRAPH:1]The 
"classic period" of the Empire started in 1556 with the accession of Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar, better 
known as Akbar the Great. It ended with the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, although the Empire continued 
for another 150 years. During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration 
connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, 
date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian 
subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic and architectural results.[PARAGRAPH:1]Following 1725 
the empire declined rapidly, weakened by wars of succession, agrarian crises fueling local revolts, the 
growth of religious intolerance, the rise of the Maratha, Durrani, and Sikh empires and finally British 
colonialism. The last king, Bahadur Zafar Shah II, whose rule was restricted to the city of Delhi, was 
imprisoned and exiled by the British after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.[PARAGRAPH:1]The name Mughal 
is derived from the original homelands of the Timurids, the Central Asian steppes once conquered by Genghis 
Khan and hence known as Moghulistan, "Land of Mongols". Although early Mughals spoke the Chagatai language 
and maintained Turko-Mongol practices, they were essentially Persianized. They transferred the Persian 
literature and culture to India, thus forming the base for the Indo-Persian culture.</English>

[\BOLD] 1542 - 1605[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar 
was the son of Nasiruddin Humayun whom he succeeded as ruler of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1605. 
He was the grandson of Babur who founded the Mughal dynasty. On the eve of his death in 1605, the Mughal 
empire spanned almost 1 million square kilometers (doubling during Akbar's reign).[PARAGRAPH:1]Akbar, 
widely considered the greatest of the Mughal emperors, was only 14 when he ascended the throne in Delhi, 
following the death of his father Humayun. He was descended from Turks, Mongols, and Iranians  the three 
peoples who predominated in the political elites of northern India in medieval times. It took him the 
better part of two decades to consolidate his power and bring parts of northern and central India into 
his realm. During his reign, he reduced external military threats from the Afghan descendants of Sher 
Shah by waging wars against Afghan tribes, and at the Second Battle of Panipat he defeated the Hindu 
king Samrat Hemu Chandra Vikramaditya, also called Hemu. The emperor solidified his rule by pursuing 
diplomacy with the powerful Rajput caste, and by admitting Rajput princesses in his harem.[PARAGRAPH:1]Akbar 
is recorded as saying "A monarch should be ever intent on conquest, lest his neighbours rise in arms 
against him", and he went on to expand the Mughal empire to include Malwa (1562), Gujarat (1572), Bengal 
(1574), Kabul (1581), Kashmir (1586), and Kandesh (1601), among others. Akbar installed a governor over 
each of the conquered provinces, under his authority.[PARAGRAPH:1]Akbar's tax reforms were especially 
noteworthy, and formed the basis of the Mughal Empire's immense wealth in succeeding generations. His 
officials prepared a detailed and accurate cadaster (land register) noting each land parcel's soil quality, 
water access, etc., and so assessed their value, taking account of prevailing prices for various crops 
in each region. This was a distinct improvement on earlier land tax systems, including the Egyptian and 
Roman ones, which had levied land taxes as an in-kind share of the harvest. By making taxes reflect the 
value of the land rather than the harvest, this stimulated both improvements in investments and more 
productive use of the land. The economic effect was such that the revered Qing emperor Kang Xi adopted 
similar measures a century later in China, with similar success.[PARAGRAPH:1]Akbar was an artisan, artist, 
armorer, blacksmith, carpenter, emperor, general, inventor, animal trainer (reputedly keeping thousands 
of hunting cheetahs during his reign and training many himself), lacemaker, technologist and theologian. 
His most lasting contributions were to the arts. He initiated a large collection of literature, including 
the Akbar-nama and the Ain-i-Akbari, and incorporated art from around the world into the Mughal collections. 
He also commissioned the building of widely admired buildings, and invented the first prefabricated homes 
and movable structures. Akbar began a series of religious debates where Muslim scholars would debate 
religious matters with Sikhs, Hindus, Carvaka atheists and even Jesuits from Portugal. He founded his 
own religious cult, the Din-i-Ilahi or the "Divine Faith"; however, it amounted only to a form of personality 
cult for Akbar, and quickly dissolved after his death leaving his wife behind.</English>
