		<English>[TAB]Kuwait, officially the State of Kuwait, is an Arab country in Western Asia. Situated 
in the northern edge of Eastern Arabia at the tip of the Persian Gulf, it shares borders with Iraq and 
Saudi Arabia. As of 2014, Kuwait has a population of 4.1 million people; 1.2 million are Kuwaitis and 
2.8 million are expatriates. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Kuwait was a prosperous 
trade hub. Starting in the early 20th century, its regional economic importance declined, and by 1934 
Kuwait had lost its prominence in long-distance trade. Kuwait's economy was devastated by several trade 
blockades. During World War I, the British Empire imposed a blockade against Kuwait because its ruler 
supported the Ottoman Empire.Following the Kuwait-Najd War of 1919-1920, Saudi Arabia maintained a trade 
blockade against the country from 1923 until 1937. In 1990, Kuwait was invaded by Iraq. The Iraqi occupation 
came to an end in 1991 after military intervention by United States-led forces.</English>
