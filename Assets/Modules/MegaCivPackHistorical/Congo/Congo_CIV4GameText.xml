		<English>[TAB]The Congo Empire represents a variety of central African empires that flourished in the pre-Colonial period between 1400 and 1900.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Kingdom of Kongo (1400-1888) was an African kingdom located in west central Africa in what are now northern Angola, Cabinda, Republic of the Congo, and the western portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At its greatest extent, it reached from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Kwango River in the east, and from the Congo River in the north to the Kwanza River in the south. The kingdom consisted of several core provinces ruled by a monarch, the Manikongo (sixteenth century spelling of 'Mwene Kongo) of the Bakongo (Kongo peoples, also known as the Essikongo), but its sphere of influence extended to the neighboring states such as Ngoyo, Kakongo, Ndongo and Matamba as well. People speaking ancient versions of Kikongo probably arrived in the region from the north as part of the larger Bantu migration. They were practicing agriculture by at least 1000 BC, and working iron by at least 400 BC, though both these dates may be pushed back by more archaeological work.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Luba Empire (1585-1889) was a pre-colonial Central African state, which arose in the marshy grasslands of the Upemba depression in what is now southern Democratic Republic of Congo. The Luba Empire was founded by King Kongolo around 1585. His nephew and immediate, Kalala Ilunga, expanded the Empire over the upper left bank territories of the Lualaba River. At its peak, the state had about a million people paying tribute to its king. The Luba Empire's success was due in large part to its development of a form of a government durable enough to withstand the disruptions of succession disputes and flexible enough to incorporate foreign leaders and governments. The Luba model of governing was so successful, it was adopted by the Lunda and spread throughout the region that is today northern Angola, northwestern Zambia, and southern Democratic Republic of Congo.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Lunda Empire or Kingdom arose in the 17th century in what is now DR Congo when Ilunga Tshibinda left the Luba kingdom of his brother and married a princess from an area to the south. Their son, Mwaant Yav or Mwata Yamvo formed the central Lunda kingdom with a population of about 175,000 and became its ruler from 1660 to 1665. His title and name was passed to his descendants and successors as rulers of the kingdom. The Lunda people were able to settle and colonialize other areas and tribes, thus extending their empire to include eastern Angola, north-western Zambia and southwest Katanga Province of DR Congo.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Kuba Kingdom (1625-1900) was a pre-colonial Central African state surrounded by the Sankuru, Lulua and Kasai rivers in the southeast of what is today the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). The kingdom began as a conglomeration of several chiefdoms of various tribes and ethnic groups with no real central authority. In approximately 1625, an individual from outside the area known as Shyaam a-Mbul a Ngoong-Shyaam usurped one of the area rulers and united all the chiefdoms under his leadership. The Kuba Kingdom reached its apex during the mid 19th century. Europeans first reached the area in 1884. Because of their relative isolation, the kingdom was not as affected by the slave trade as the Kongo or Ndongo kingdoms on the coast. Toward the end of the 19th century, the kingdom was invaded by the Nsapo people. The weakened Kingdom never recovered and fractured into chiefdoms once again by the time of the Belgian Protectorate.</English>

He formed a totalitarian regime in Zaire which attempted to purge the country of all colonial cultural influence and entered wars to challenge the rise of communism in other African countries. His mismanagement of his country's economy, and personal enrichment from its financial and natural resources, makes his name synonymous with kleptocracy in Africa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Following the granting of independence on June 30, 1960, a coalition government was formed, led by Prime Minister Lumumba and President Joseph Kasa-Vubu. The new nation quickly lurched into the Congo Crisis as the army mutinied against the remaining Belgian officers. Lumumba appointed Mobutu as Chief of Staff of the Army and in that capacity, Mobutu toured the country convincing soldiers to return to their barracks. Encouraged by a Belgian government intent on maintaining its access to rich Congolese mines, secessionist violence erupted in the south. Miffed that the United Nations force sent to help restore order was not helping to crush the secessionists, Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for assistance, receiving massive military aid and about a thousand Soviet technical advisers in six weeks. The U.S. government saw the Soviet activity as a maneuver to spread communist influence in Central Africa. Kasavubu, riled by the Soviet arrival, dismissed Lumumba. An outraged Lumumba declared Kasavubu deposed. Both Lumumba and Kasavubu then ordered Mobutu to arrest the other. As Army Chief of Staff, Mobutu came under great pressure from multiple sources. The embassies of Western nations, which helped pay the soldiers' salaries, as well as Kasavubu and Mobutu's subordinates favored getting rid of the Soviet presence. On September 14, 1960, Mobutu took controlin a CIA-sponsored coup. The new regime placed Lumumba under house arrest for the second time and kept Kasavubu as president.[PARAGRAPH:1]On November 25, 1965, General Mobutu seized power for the second time in a bloodless coup, following another power struggle between Kasavubu and his prime minister Moise Tshombe. According to Mobutu, it had taken "the politicians" five years to "ruin" the country; therefore, said Mobutu, "For five years, there will be no more political party activity in the country." Under the auspice of a regime d'exception (the equivalent of a state of emergency), Mobutu assumed sweeping (almost absolute) powers. Parliament was reduced to a rubber-stamp, before being abolished altogether though it was later revived. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralized state.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1964, Pierre Mulele led partisans in another rebellion. They quickly occupied two thirds of The Congo, but the Congolese army, led by Mobutu, was able to reconquer the entire territory in 1965. Mobutu was overthrown in the First Congo War by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who was supported by the governments of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tutsis had long opposed Mobutu, due to his open support for Rwandan Hutu extremists responsible for the Rwandan genocide in 1994. When his government issued an order in November 1996 forcing Tutsis to leave Zaire on penalty of death, they erupted in rebellion. From eastern Zaire, with the support of President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Rwandan Minister of Defense Paul Kagame, they launched an offensive to overthrow Mobutu, joining forces with locals opposed to him as they marched west toward Kinshasa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ailing with cancer, Mobutu was unable to coordinate the resistance, which crumbled in front of the march, the army being more used to suppressing civilians than defending the large country. On May 16, 1997, following failed peace talks, the Tutsi rebels and other anti-Mobutu groups as the Alliance des Forces Democratiques pour la Liberation du Congo-Zaire (AFDL) captured Kinshasa. Zaire was renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mobutu died on September 7, 1997 in exile in Rabat, Morocco, from prostate cancer.</English>

		<Italian>[H1]Mobutu Sese Seko[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Zaire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1930 - 1997[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu wa Za Banga, commonly known as Mobutu, or Mobutu Sese Seko, born Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, was the President of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) for 32 years (1965-1997) after deposing Joseph Kasavubu. He formed a totalitarian regime in Zaire which attempted to purge the country of all colonial cultural influence and entered wars to challenge the rise of communism in other African countries. His mismanagement of his country's economy, and personal enrichment from its financial and natural resources, makes his name synonymous with kleptocracy in Africa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Following the granting of independence on June 30, 1960, a coalition government was formed, led by Prime Minister Lumumba and President Joseph Kasa-Vubu. The new nation quickly lurched into the Congo Crisis as the army mutinied against the remaining Belgian officers. Lumumba appointed Mobutu as Chief of Staff of the Army and in that capacity, Mobutu toured the country convincing soldiers to return to their barracks. Encouraged by a Belgian government intent on maintaining its access to rich Congolese mines, secessionist violence erupted in the south. Miffed that the United Nations force sent to help restore order was not helping to crush the secessionists, Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for assistance, receiving massive military aid and about a thousand Soviet technical advisers in six weeks. The U.S. government saw the Soviet activity as a maneuver to spread communist influence in Central Africa. Kasavubu, riled by the Soviet arrival, dismissed Lumumba. An outraged Lumumba declared Kasavubu deposed. Both Lumumba and Kasavubu then ordered Mobutu to arrest the other. As Army Chief of Staff, Mobutu came under great pressure from multiple sources. The embassies of Western nations, which helped pay the soldiers' salaries, as well as Kasavubu and Mobutu's subordinates favored getting rid of the Soviet presence. On September 14, 1960, Mobutu took controlin a CIA-sponsored coup. The new regime placed Lumumba under house arrest for the second time and kept Kasavubu as president.[PARAGRAPH:1]On November 25, 1965, General Mobutu seized power for the second time in a bloodless coup, following another power struggle between Kasavubu and his prime minister Moise Tshombe. According to Mobutu, it had taken "the politicians" five years to "ruin" the country; therefore, said Mobutu, "For five years, there will be no more political party activity in the country." Under the auspice of a regime d'exception (the equivalent of a state of emergency), Mobutu assumed sweeping (almost absolute) powers. Parliament was reduced to a rubber-stamp, before being abolished altogether though it was later revived. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralized state.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1964, Pierre Mulele led partisans in another rebellion. They quickly occupied two thirds of The Congo, but the Congolese army, led by Mobutu, was able to reconquer the entire territory in 1965. Mobutu was overthrown in the First Congo War by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who was supported by the governments of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tutsis had long opposed Mobutu, due to his open support for Rwandan Hutu extremists responsible for the Rwandan genocide in 1994. When his government issued an order in November 1996 forcing Tutsis to leave Zaire on penalty of death, they erupted in rebellion. From eastern Zaire, with the support of President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Rwandan Minister of Defense Paul Kagame, they launched an offensive to overthrow Mobutu, joining forces with locals opposed to him as they marched west toward Kinshasa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ailing with cancer, Mobutu was unable to coordinate the resistance, which crumbled in front of the march, the army being more used to suppressing civilians than defending the large country.

The name Nimi a Lukeni appeared in later oral traditions and some modern historians, notably Jean Cuvelier, popularized it. Nimi became the founder of Kongo when, around 1400, he moved his capital to Mbanza Kongo on a mountain that lay to the south and was conquered from Mwene Kabunga (or Mwene Mpangala) whose descendants symbolically challenged the conquest annually two centuries later.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was the offpsring of his father Nimi and the Mwene Mbata's daughter, according to traditions recorded by Giovanni Cavazzi da Montecuccolo in the mid 17th century. Although he probably ruled in the valley of the Kwilu River in modern day Democratic Republic of Congo, he is credited with conquering the region of modern day Mbanza Kongo, displacing a localruler named Mwene Mpangala and building his capital there. He probably ruled in the late 14th century.[PARAGRAPH:1]In Jesuit-authored accounts, Lukeni lua Nimi is presented as a conqueror who came from the north, on the other side of the Congo River. In one account, he was the younger son of a king, unlikely to succeed to power after his father, and seeking a new kingdom of his own. In another account, he commits a dreadful double homicide, stabbing his pregnant mother through the womb; then, gathering his followers, who are encouraged rather than repelled by this gruesome murder, he conquers Kongo.[PARAGRAPH:1]People speaking ancient versions of Kikongo probably arrived in the region from the north as part of the larger Bantu migration.
