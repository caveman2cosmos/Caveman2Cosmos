		<English>[TAB]The Croats are largely Slavic people who lived in an area of what is today Galicia (in Ukraine and Poland). From there they migrated further south to present-day Croatia during the 7th century. Nominally under East Roman and then Frankish authority, Croatia eventually became a strong independent kingdom under king Tomislav in 925, but in 1102 the Croatians ended a decade-long dynastic struggle by agreeing to submit themselves to Hungarian authority.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the mid-1400s, the Hungarian kingdom was gravely hurt by the Ottoman expansion as much of the mountainous country now known as Bosnia and Herzegovina fell to the Turks. At the same time, Dalmatia became mostly Venetian. Dubrovnik was a city-state that was firstly Byzantine (Roman) and Venetian, but later, unlike other Dalmatian city-states, it became independent as Republic of Dubrovnik, even if it was often under the suzerainty of neighboring powers.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Battle of Mohács in 1526 led the Croatian Parliament to invite the Habsburgs, under Ferdinand I, to assume control over Croatia. Habsburg rule eventually did prove to be successful in thwarting the Ottomans, and by the 18th century, much of Croatia was free of Turkish control. The odd crescent shape of the Croatian lands remained as a mark, more or less, of the frontier to the Ottoman advance into Europe. Istria, Dalmatia and Dubrovnik all eventually passed to the Habsburg Monarchy between 1797 and 1815.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following World War I and the demise of Austria-Hungary, Croatia joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which became Yugoslavia in 1929). Yugoslavia was invaded during World War II and Croatia was turned into a fascist puppet-state named the Independent State of Croatia. After the defeat of the Axis powers, Yugoslavia became a federal socialist state under the strong hand of Josip Broz Tito.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1990, the first free elections were held. A people's movement called the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) won, led by Franjo Tudjman General of Croatian WW2 antifascist movment, the Partisans. HDZ's intentions were to secure more independence for Croatia, contrary to the wishes of part of ethnic Serbs in the republic and official politics in Belgrade. The excessively polarized climate soon escalated into complete estrangement between the two nationalities and even sectarian violence.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the summer of 1990, Serbs from the mountainous areas where they constitute a relative majority rebelled and formed an unrecognized "Autonomous Region of the Serb Krajina" (later the Republic of Serbian Krajina). Any intervention by the Croatian police was obstructed by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), mainly consiteted of Serbs. The conflict culminated with the so-called "log revolution", when Krajina Serbs blocked the roads to the tourist destinations in Dalmatia and started a mass ethnic cleansing of all non-Serb population.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Croatian government declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, and the JNA launch an open agression on Republic and backing up local Serb militia's. Many Croatian cities, notably Vukovar and Dubrovnik, came under the attack of the Serbian forces. Croatian Parliament cut all remaining ties with Yugoslavia in October that year.[PARAGRAPH:2]The civilian population fled the areas of armed conflict en masse: generally speaking, thousands of Croats moved away from the Bosnian and Serbian border, while thousands of Serbs moved towards it. In many places, masses of civilians were forced out by the Yugoslav National Army (JNA), which consisted mostly from conscripts from Serbia and Montenegro, and irregulars from Serbia, in what became known as ethnic cleansing.[PARAGRAPH:2]The border city of Vukovar underwent a three month siege - the Battle of Vukovar - during which most of the city buildings were destroyed and a majority of the population was forced to flee. The city fell to the Serbian forces in late November 1991. Soon after, shocked with atrocites commited by Serbs, the foreign countries started recognizing Croatia's independence. By the end of January 1992, most of the world recognized the country.[PARAGRAPH:2]Subsequent UN-sponsored cease-fires followed, and the warring parties mostly entrenched. The Yugoslav People's Army retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina where war was just about to start. During 1992 and 1993, Croatia also handled seven hundred thousands of refugees from Bosnia, mainly Bosnia's Moslems.[PARAGRAPH:2]Armed conflict in Croatia remained intermittent and mostly on a small scale until 1995. In early August, Croatia started Operation Storm and Croatian Garde brigades quickly liberated most of so called Krajina, causing a mass exodus of the Serbian population. A few months later, as a result, the war ended upon the negotiation of the Dayton Agreement.[PARAGRAPH:2]President Tudjman died in late 1999 and the country underwent many liberal reforms beginning in 2000. An economic recovery as well as healing of many war wounds ensued and the country proceeded to become a member of several important regional and international organizations. The country is currently in process of joining the European Union under the government of Prime Minister Sanader.</English>

He reigned from 910 until his death and declared himself the first King of the medieval Croatian state in 925.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was crowned king at the fields of Tomislavgrad in 925 by order of Pope John X. During his life he united the Pannonian and Dalmatian duchies to form a Croatian Kingdom. Under his rule, Croatia became one of the most powerful kingdoms in medieval Europe.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was member of the Trpimirovic dynasty and probably the son of Dalmatian duke (knez) Mutimir. Tomislav himself became duke of Dalmatia around 910.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tomislav defeated the Magyars in battle and forced them across the Drava River. Since then this river has been the age-old border between these two people. Tomislav also annexed Sava Croatia to his state. This included the area between the rivers Drava, Sava and Kupa, which would later be known as Slavonia. This was the first time that the two Croatian principalities were united.[PARAGRAPH:1]King Tomislav allied himself with the Byzantine Empire, and had to repel the attacks of the Bulgarians who invaded Croatia due to Tomislav's friendship with the Byzantines. The Croats fought the army of Simeon I of Bulgaria led by duke Alobogotur on May 27, 927 and won Battle of the Bosnian Highlands. This huge battle is considered to be one of the greatest and bloodiest single-day battles in history. As ally of the Byzantium, he was granted the right to administer the coastal cities (Zadar, Split, Trogir, so-called Byzantine Dalmatia) and thus rounded off his state from the Adriatic Sea to the Drava River, and from the Rasa River in Istria to the Drina River.[PARAGRAPH:1]After he became King in 925, at two church synods in Split, he established the relationship between the dioceses of Split (Latin) and of Nin (Croatian), and in this way strengthened internal relations in Croatia and resolved the dispute around the liturgical language between the Latinists and Croatian Glagolites (users of Glagolitic alphabet). Through this, Tomislav obtained the support of the Pope, who was at that time the most important power in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tomislav's organized a strong military state. His army and navy was consisted of, approximately, 100,000 infantry, 60,000 cavaliers, 80 large and 100 smaller battleships.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tomislav disappeared in 928, and it is still not known where or how he actually died. At the time of his death there was discord in the country over whether the liturgical language of the Roman Catholic Church in Croatia would be Latin or Croatian.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tomislav is celebrated as the founder of the first united Croatian state. In the Croatian capital of Zagreb, there is a square dedicated to Tomislav. Near the place where he was crowned lies the town of Tomislavgrad (Tomislav's City).</English>

He reigned from 910 until his death and declared himself the first King of the medieval Croatian state in 925.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was crowned king at the fields of Tomislavgrad in 925 by order of Pope John X. During his life he united the Pannonian and Dalmatian duchies to form a Croatian Kingdom. Under his rule, Croatia became one of the most powerful kingdoms in medieval Europe.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was member of the Trpimirovic dynasty and probably the son of Dalmatian duke (knez) Mutimir. Tomislav himself became duke of Dalmatia around 910.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tomislav defeated the Magyars in battle and forced them across the Drava River. Since then this river has been the age-old border between these two people. Tomislav also annexed Sava Croatia to his state. This included the area between the rivers Drava, Sava and Kupa, which would later be known as Slavonia. This was the first time that the two Croatian principalities were united.[PARAGRAPH:1]King Tomislav allied himself with the Byzantine Empire, and had to repel the attacks of the Bulgarians who invaded Croatia due to Tomislav's friendship with the Byzantines. The Croats fought the army of Simeon I of Bulgaria led by duke Alobogotur on May 27, 927 and won Battle of the Bosnian Highlands. This huge battle is considered to be one of the greatest and bloodiest single-day battles in history. As ally of the Byzantium, he was granted the right to administer the coastal cities (Zadar, Split, Trogir, so-called Byzantine Dalmatia) and thus rounded off his state from the Adriatic Sea to the Drava River, and from the Rasa River in Istria to the Drina River.[PARAGRAPH:1]After he became King in 925, at two church synods in Split, he established the relationship between the dioceses of Split (Latin) and of Nin (Croatian), and in this way strengthened internal relations in Croatia and resolved the dispute around the liturgical language between the Latinists and Croatian Glagolites (users of Glagolitic alphabet). Through this, Tomislav obtained the support of the Pope, who was at that time the most important power in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tomislav's organized a strong military state. His army and navy was consisted of, approximately, 100,000 infantry, 60,000 cavaliers, 80 large and 100 smaller battleships.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tomislav disappeared in 928, and it is still not known where or how he actually died. At the time of his death there was discord in the country over whether the liturgical language of the Roman Catholic Church in Croatia would be Latin or Croatian.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tomislav is celebrated as the founder of the first united Croatian state. In the Croatian capital of Zagreb, there is a square dedicated to Tomislav. Near the place where he was crowned lies the town of Tomislavgrad (Tomislav's City).</German>
