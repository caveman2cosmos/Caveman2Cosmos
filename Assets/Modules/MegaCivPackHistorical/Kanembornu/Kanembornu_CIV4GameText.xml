		<English>[TAB]The Kanem-Bornu Empire existed in modern Chad and Nigeria. It was known to the Arab geographers 
as the Kanem Empire from the 9th century AD onward and lasted, in some form, until 1893. At its height 
it encompassed an area covering not only much of Chad, but also parts of modern southern Libya, eastern 
Niger, northeastern Nigeria and northern Cameroon. The Kanem Empire originated at an unknown period to 
the northeast of Lake Chad. It was located at the southern end of the trans-Saharan trade route between 
Tripoli and the region of Lake Chad. Besides its urban elite it included a confederation of nomadic peoples.[PARAGRAPH:2]The 
major factor that influenced the history of the state of Kanem was the early penetration of Islam. North 
African traders, Berbers and Arabs, brought the new religion. Towards 1068, Hummay, a member of the Sayfawa 
establishment, who was already a Muslim, discarded the last Duguwa king Selma from power and thus established 
the new dynasty of the Sayfuwa. Islam offered the Sayfawa rulers the advantage of new ideas from Arabia 
and the Mediterranean world, as well as literacy in administration. But many people resisted the new 
religion favouring traditional beliefs and practices. When Hummay had assumed power on the basis of his 
strong Islamic following, for example, it is believed that the Duguwa/Zaghawa began some kind of internal 
opposition. This pattern of conflict and compromise with Islam occurs repeatedly in Chadian history.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kanem-Bornu 
peaked during the reign of the outstanding statesman Mai Idris Aluma (c. 1571-1603). Aluma is remembered 
for his military skills, administrative reforms, and Islamic piety. His main adversaries were the Hausa 
to the west, the Tuareg and Toubou to the north, and the Bulala to the east. One epic poem extols his 
victories in 330 wars and more than 1,000 battles. His innovations included the employment of fixed military 
camps (with walls); permanent sieges and "scorched earth" tactics, where soldiers burned everything in 
their path; armored horses and riders; and the use of Berber camelry, Kotoko boatmen, and iron-helmeted 
musketeers trained by Turkish military advisers.[PARAGRAPH:2]Aluma introduced a number of legal and administrative 
reforms based on his religious beliefs and Islamic law (sharia). He sponsored the construction of numerous 
mosques and made a pilgrimage to Mecca, where he arranged for the establishment of a hostel to be used 
by pilgrims from his empire. As with other dynamic politicians, Aluma's reformist goals led him to seek 
loyal and competent advisers and allies, and he frequently relied on slaves who had been educated in 
noble homes. Aluma regularly sought advice from a council composed of heads of the most important clans. 
He required major political figures to live at the court, and he reinforced political alliances through 
appropriate marriages (Aluma himself was the son of a Kanuri father and a Bulala mother).[PARAGRAPH:2]Although 
the dynasty ended, the kingdom of Kanem-Bornu survived. But Umar, who eschewed the title mai for the 
simpler designation shehu (from the Arabic shaykh), could not match his father's vitality and gradually 
allowed the kingdom to be ruled by advisers (wazirs). Bornu began to decline, as a result of administrative 
disorganization, regional particularism, and attacks by the militant Ouaddai Empire to the east. The 
decline continued under Umar's sons, and in 1893 Rabih az-Zubayr, leading an invading army from eastern 
Sudan, conquered Bornu.</English>

relations with Tripoli, Egypt, and the Ottoman Empire, which sent a 200-member ambassadorial party across 
the desert to Alooma's court at Ngazargamu. Alooma also signed what was probably the first written treaty 
or cease-fire in Chadian history.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alooma introduced a number of legal and administrative

people had to be conquered), sales of slaves, and duties on and participation in trans-Saharan trade. 
Unlike West Africa, the Chadian region did not have gold. Still, it was central to one of the most convenient 
trans-Saharan routes. Between Lake Chad and Fezzan lay a sequence of well-spaced wells and oases, and 
from Fezzan there were easy connections to North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea. Many products were 
sent north, including natron (sodium carbonate), cotton, kola nuts, ivory, ostrich feathers, perfume, 
wax, and hides, but the most important of all were slaves. Imports included salt, horses, silks, glass, 
muskets, and copper.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alooma took a keen interest in trade and other economic matters. He 
is credited with having the roads cleared, designing better boats for Lake Chad, introducing standard 
units of measure for grain, and moving farmers into new lands. In addition, he improved the ease and 
security of transit through the empire with the goal of making it so safe that "a lone woman clad in

He required major political figures to live at the court, and he reinforced political alliances through 
appropriate marriages (Alooma himself was the son of a Kanuri father and a Bulala mother).[PARAGRAPH:1]Kanem-Bornu

people had to be conquered), sales of slaves, and duties on and participation in trans-Saharan trade. 
Unlike West Africa, the Chadian region did not have gold. Still, it was central to one of the most convenient 
trans-Saharan routes. Between Lake Chad and Fezzan lay a sequence of well-spaced wells and oases, and 
from Fezzan there were easy connections to North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea. Many products were 
sent north, including natron (sodium carbonate), cotton, kola nuts, ivory, ostrich feathers, perfume, 
wax, and hides, but the most important of all were slaves. Imports included salt, horses, silks, glass, 
muskets, and copper.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alooma took a keen interest in trade and other economic matters. He 
is credited with having the roads cleared, designing better boats for Lake Chad, introducing standard 
units of measure for grain, and moving farmers into new lands. In addition, he improved the ease and 
security of transit through the empire with the goal of making it so safe that "a lone woman clad in 
gold might walk with none to fear but God.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Alooma[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mai of the Kanem-Bornu Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1571 
- 1603[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Idris Alooma was mai (king) of the 
Kanem-Bornu Empire, located mainly in Chad and Nigeria. An outstanding statesman, under his rule (1571-1603) 
Kanem-Bornu touched the zenith of its power. Idris is remembered for his military skills, administrative 
reforms, and Islamic piety. His feats are mainly known through his chronicler Ahmad bin Fartuwa.[PARAGRAPH:1]His 
main adversaries were the Hausa to the west, the Tuareg and Toubou to the north, and the Bulala to the 
east. One epic poem extols his victories in 330 wars and more than 1,000 battles. His innovations included 
the employment of fixed military camps (with walls); permanent sieges and "scorched earth" tactics, where 
soldiers burned everything in their path; armored horses and riders; and the use of Berber camelry, Kotoko 
boatmen, and iron-helmeted musketeers trained by Turkish military advisers. His active diplomacy featured 
relations with Tripoli, Egypt, and the Ottoman Empire, which sent a 200-member ambassadorial party across 
the desert to Alooma's court at Ngazargamu. Alooma also signed what was probably the first written treaty 
or cease-fire in Chadian history.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alooma introduced a number of legal and administrative 
reforms based on his religious beliefs and Islamic law (sharia). He sponsored the construction of numerous 
mosques and made a pilgrimage to Mecca, where he arranged for the establishment of a hostel to be used 
by pilgrims from his empire. As with other dynamic politicians, Alooma's reformist goals led him to seek 
loyal and competent advisers and allies, and he frequently relied on slaves who had been educated in 
noble homes. Alooma regularly sought advice from a council composed of heads of the most important clans. 
He required major political figures to live at the court, and he reinforced political alliances through 
appropriate marriages (Alooma himself was the son of a Kanuri father and a Bulala mother).[PARAGRAPH:1]Kanem-Bornu
