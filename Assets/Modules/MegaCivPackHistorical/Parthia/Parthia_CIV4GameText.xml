		<English>[TAB]The Parthian Empire, also known as the Arsacid Empire, was a major Iranian political 
and cultural power in ancient Iran.  Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of 
the Parni tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Iran's 
northeast, then a satrapy (province) in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I of Parthia 
(r. c. 171-138 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At 
its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now 
central-eastern Turkey, to eastern Iran. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the 
Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han Empire of China, became a center of trade and commerce.</English>
