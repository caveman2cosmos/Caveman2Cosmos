		<English>[H1]Edward Teach[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD] (c. 1680 – November 22, 1718), better known as Blackbeard, was a notorious English pirate in the Caribbean Sea and western Atlantic during the early 18th century, a period referred to as the Golden Age of Piracy. His best known vessel was the Queen Anne's Revenge, which is believed to have run aground near Beaufort Inlet in the Inner Banks of North Carolina in 1718.
In A General Historie of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates, it was reported that he had lit matches woven into his enormous black beard during battle to intimidate his enemies. Blackbeard is often regarded as the archetypal image of the seafaring pirate</English>

		<English>[H1]Henry Morgan[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Welsh Privateer, Lieutenant-Governor of Jamaica[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: 
[\BOLD]1635 - 1688[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Henry Morgan was a Welsh adventurer, the eldest son of Robert Morgan, a squire of Llanrhymny in Glamorgan, Wales, and nephew of Edward Morgan, Lieutenant-Governor of Jamaica. Legend holds that he was kidnapped from Bristol as a boy and sold into slavery in Barbados, before eventually coming to the Antilles as part of the invasion force that captured Jamaica and joining the piratical fleet of Christopher Myngs. By 1666 he was captain of his own vessel, and in 1667 he was commissioned as Admiral of Privateers by the English governor of Jamaica, Thomas Modyford. Over the next few years he captured numerous ships and plundered Spanish cities, including Puerto Bello and Maracaibo. [PARAGRAPH:1]His signal triumph, however, came in 1671, when leading a force of nearly 
2,000 freebooters and buccaneers he took Panama, the richest city in the New World, despite the Treaty of Madrid (signed the previous year), by which England pledged to stop attacks on Spanish possessions. [PARAGRAPH:1]To mollify the Spanish, Morgan was "arrested" and ordered back to England, where he was greeted as a hero. Avoiding prosecution by claiming ignorance of the Treaty of Madrid, he was knighted Sir Henry Morgan by King Charles II and appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Jamaica, where he lived a pleasant life amid his large plantations. He died in his bed (either of tuberculosis or liver failure from heavy drinking), surrounded by loved ones -- something achieved by very few pirates of his (or any) day. [PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]NOTE: 
[\BOLD]The graphical representation of Sir Henry Morgan used in this mod is based on popular lithographs made of the privateer after his death and the author's own imagination.

		<English>[TAB]In the popular modern imagination, pirates of the classical period were rebellious, clever teams who operated outside the restricting bureaucracy of modern life. In reality, many pirates ate poorly, did not become fabulously wealthy, and died young. Unlike traditional Western societies of the time, many pirate clans operated as limited democracies, demanding the right to elect and replace their leaders. The captain of a pirate ship was often a fierce fighter in whom the men could place their trust, rather than a more traditional authority figure sanctioned by an elite. However, when not in battle, the ship's quartermaster usually had the real authority. Many groups of pirates shared in whatever they seized; pirates injured in battle might be afforded special compensation. Often all of these terms were agreed upon and written down by the pirates, but these articles could also be used as incriminating proof that they were outlaws. Pirates readily accepted outcasts from traditional societies, perhaps easily recognizing kindred spirits, and they were known to welcome them into the pirate fold. Such practices within a pirate clan were tenuous, however, and did little to mitigate the brutality of the pirate's way of life.[PARAGRAPH:2]The classical age of piracy coexisted with a rise in English imperialism which required merchant vessels to transport goods and warships to protect the trade ships from pirates and privateers. Living conditions on the warships were horrible even by 17th-century standards; sailors were often fed rotten, maggot-infested food, frequently suffered from scurvy or other nutritional disorders, and could be counted lucky to escape their service without a debilitating injury. English captains were known to have been extremely brutal; the captain held a nearly sovereign power aboard his ship and many were unafraid to abuse that power. To fill the warships, officers would sometimes forcibly conscript boys and young men to replace lost crew. The horrid living conditions, constant threat to life, and brutality of the captain and his officers pushed many men over the edge. Possessing seafaring skill, a learned intolerance for absolute authority, and a disdain for the motherland they might have believed abandoned them, many crews would simply mutiny during an attack and offer themselves and their ship as a new pirate vessel and crew.[PARAGRAPH:2]</English>
