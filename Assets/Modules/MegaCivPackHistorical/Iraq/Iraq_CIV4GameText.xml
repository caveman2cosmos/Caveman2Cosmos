		<English>[TAB]Iraq, officially the Republic of Iraq, is a country in Western Asia. The country borders 
Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to 
the southwest, and Syria to the west. The southern part of Iraq is within the Arabian Peninsula. The 
capital, Baghdad, is in the center of the country and its largest city. The largest ethnic groups in 
Iraq are Arabs and Kurds. Other ethnic groups include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Armenians, Mandeans, 
Circassians and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Shia or Sunni Muslims, with 
Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism and Mandeanism also present. Iraq has a narrow section of coastline measuring 
58 km (36 mi) on the northern Persian Gulf and its territory encompasses the Mesopotamian Alluvial Plain, 
the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range, and the eastern part of the Syrian Desert. Two major 
rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, run south through the center of Iraq and flow into the Shatt al-Arab 
near the Persian Gulf. These rivers provide Iraq with significant amounts of fertile land.</English>

28 April 1937 - 30 December 2006[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Saddam Hussein 
Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti was the fifth President of Iraq, serving in this capacity from 16 July 1979 until 
9 April 2003.[5][6] A leading member of the revolutionary Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, and later, the 
Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party and its regional organization Ba'ath Party - Iraq Region-which espoused ba'athism, 
a mix of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism-Saddam played a key role in the 1968 coup (later referred 
to as the 17 July Revolution) that brought the party to power in Iraq. As vice president under the ailing 
General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, and at a time when many groups were considered capable of overthrowing 
the government, Saddam created security forces through which he tightly controlled conflict between the 
government and the armed forces. In the early 1970s, Saddam nationalized oil and other industries. The 
state-owned banks were put under his control, leaving the system eventually insolvent mostly due to the 
Iran-Iraq War, the Gulf War, and UN sanctions. Through the 1970s, Saddam cemented his authority over 
the apparatuses of government as oil money helped Iraq's economy to grow at a rapid pace. Positions of 
power in the country were mostly filled with Sunnis, a minority that made up only a fifth of the population.</English>
