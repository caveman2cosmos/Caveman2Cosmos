		<English>[TAB]The borders of present-day Bangladesh were established with the partition of Bengal and 
India in 1947, when the region became the eastern wing of the newly formed Pakistan. However, it was 
separated from the western wing by 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) across India. Political and linguistic 
discrimination as well as economic neglect led to popular agitations against West Pakistan, which led 
to the war for independence in 1971 and the establishment of Bangladesh. After independence the new state 
endured famines, natural disasters and widespread poverty, as well as political turmoil and military 
coups. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by relative calm and economic progress.[PARAGRAPH:2]Bangladesh 
is the seventh most populous country in the world and is among the most densely populated countries in 
the world with a high poverty rate. However, per-capita GDP has more than doubled since 1975, and the 
poverty rate has fallen by 20% since the early 1990s. The country is listed among the "Next Eleven" economies. 
Dhaka and other urban centers have been the driving force behind this growth.[PARAGRAPH:2]Remnants of 
civilization in the greater Bengal region date back four thousand years, when the region was settled 
by Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman, and Austro-Asiatic peoples. The exact origin of the word "Bangla" or "Bengal" 
is unknown, though it is believed to be derived from Bang, the Dravidian-speaking tribe that settled 
in the area around the year 1000 BC.[PARAGRAPH:2]The kingdom of Gangaridai was formed from at least the 
seventh century BC, which later united with Bihar under the Magadha, Nanda, Mauryan and Sunga Empires. 
Bengal was later part of the Gupta Empire and Harsha Empire from the third to the sixth centuries CE. 
Following its collapse, a dynamic Bengali named Shashanka founded an impressive yet short-lived kingdom. 
Shashanka is considered the first independent king in the history of Bangladesh. After a period of anarchy, 
the Buddhist Pala dynasty ruled the region for four hundred years, followed by a shorter reign of the 
Hindu Sena dynasty. Islam was introduced to Bengal in the twelfth century by Arab Muslim merchants and 
Sufi missionaries, and subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam throughout the region. Bakhtiar 
Khilji, a Turkic general, defeated Lakshman Sen of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of Bengal 
in the year 1204. The region was ruled by dynasties of Sultans and land lords Bhuiyan for the next few 
hundred years. By the 16th century, the Mughal Empire controlled Bengal, and Dhaka became an important 
provincial centre of Mughal administration.[PARAGRAPH:2]European traders arrived late in the 15th century, 
and their influence grew until the British East India Company gained control of Bengal following the 
Battle of Plassey in 1757. The bloody rebellion of 1857, known as the Sepoy Mutiny, resulted in transfer 
of authority to the crown, with a British viceroy running the administration. During colonial rule, famine 
racked the Indian subcontinent many times, including the Great Bengal famine of 1943 that claimed 3 million 
lives.[PARAGRAPH:2]In January 11, 2007, following widespread violence, a caretaker government was appointed 
to administer the next general election. The country had suffered from extensive corruption, disorder 
and political violence. The new caretaker government has made it a priority to root out corruption from 
all levels of government. To this end, many notable politicians and officials, along with large numbers 
of lesser officials and party members, have been arrested on corruption charges. The caretaker government 
held a fair and free election on December 29, 2008. Awami League's Sheikh Hasina won the elections with 
a landslide victory and took oath of Prime Minister on 6 Jan 2009.</English>

[\BOLD]1947 - [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Sheikh Hasina Wazed is a Bangladeshi 
politician and current Prime Minister of Bangladesh. She has been the President of the Awami League, 
a major political party, since 1981. She is the eldest of five children of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the 
founding father (and first president) of Bangladesh and wife of an internationally reputed nuclear scientist, 
M. A. Wazed Miah. Sheikh Hasina's party defeated the BNP-led Four-Party Alliance in the 2008 parliamentary 
elections, thus assuring her of the post of prime minister. Sheikh Hasina has once before held the office, 
from 1996 to 2001.[PARAGRAPH:1]While living in self-exile in India, Sheikh Hasina was elected the president 
of Bangladesh Awami League in 1981. After she returned to the country, the president Ziaur Rahman was 
assassinated in yet another coup in May, 1981. The following year, General Hossain Mohammad Ershad captured 
power through a bloodless coup and declared martial law. In 1983, Hasina formed the 15-party alliance 
to launch a movement to oust him from power. She was in and out of prison throughout the 1980s. Her party, 
along with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by Rahman's widow Khaleda Zia, was instrumental in the 
movement against the military rule. In 1984, Hasina was put under house arrest in February and then again 
in November. In March 1985, she was put under house arrest for three months.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1990, Hasina's 
8 party alliance was instrumental along with another BNP-led alliance in finally removing the Ershad 
regime. Under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina, Awami League formed an alliance with Ershad's Jayiya Party 
in 2006[PARAGRAPH:1]On July 16, 2007 Hasina was arrested by state police at her home and taken before 
a local court in Dhaka. She was accused of extortion and denied bail on the same day, and was held in 
a building converted into a jail on the premises of the National Parliament. According to the Awami League, 
the arrest was politically motivated. On June 11, 2008 Hasina was released on parole for medical reasons 
and the next day she flew to the United States to be treated for hearing impairment, eye problems and 
high blood pressure. Prof. Syed Modasser Ali, her personal physician, threatened to sue the caretaker 
government over negligence regarding Hasina's treatment during her detention.[PARAGRAPH:1]In November 
6, 2008 Hasina returned to Bangladesh to lead her party in general elections scheduled for December 29, 
2008. On December 11, 2008 Sheikh Hasina announced her party's election manifesto during a news conference.In 
her election manifesto she vowed to build a "Digital Bangladesh" by 2021. Sheikh Hasina's Awami league 
won the elections on 29 December 2008 with an overwhelming majority.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sheikh Hasina's party 
defeated Begum Khaleda Zia's BNP in the 2008 Parliamentary Elections. Her party achieved a landslide 
victory reminiscent to the 1971 elections of Pakistan. Under her leadership, the party has achieved a 
supermajority in parliament, controlling 230 seats out of 299. She was sworn into office as the Prime 
Minister for the second time on 6 January, 2009. The Prime Minister is the most powerful executive position 
in Bangladesh, although technically of lower seniority when compared to the office of President. Begum 
Zia, however, rejected the results of the election, sarcastically thanking the Chief Election Commissioner 
"for stage-managing the parliamentary election" in a statement. But, according to the views expressed 
by foreign and local election observers, the general election was free, fair and credible.</English>

won the elections on 29 December 2008 with an overwhelming majority.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sheikh Hasina's party 
defeated Begum Khaleda Zia's BNP in the 2008 Parliamentary Elections. Her party achieved a landslide 
victory reminiscent to the 1971 elections of Pakistan. Under her leadership, the party has achieved a 
supermajority in parliament, controlling 230 seats out of 299. She was sworn into office as the Prime 
Minister for the second time on 6 January, 2009. The Prime Minister is the most powerful executive position 
in Bangladesh, although technically of lower seniority when compared to the office of President. Begum 
Zia, however, rejected the results of the election, sarcastically thanking the Chief Election Commissioner 
"for stage-managing the parliamentary election" in a statement. But, according to the views expressed 
by foreign and local election observers, the general election was free, fair and credible.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Sheikh Hasina Wazed[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Bangladesh[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: 
[\BOLD]1947 - [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Sheikh Hasina Wazed is a Bangladeshi 
politician and current Prime Minister of Bangladesh. She has been the President of the Awami League, 
a major political party, since 1981. She is the eldest of five children of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the 
founding father (and first president) of Bangladesh and wife of an internationally reputed nuclear scientist, 
M. A. Wazed Miah. Sheikh Hasina's party defeated the BNP-led Four-Party Alliance in the 2008 parliamentary 
elections, thus assuring her of the post of prime minister. Sheikh Hasina has once before held the office, 
from 1996 to 2001.[PARAGRAPH:1]While living in self-exile in India, Sheikh Hasina was elected the president 
of Bangladesh Awami League in 1981. After she returned to the country, the president Ziaur Rahman was 
assassinated in yet another coup in May, 1981. The following year, General Hossain Mohammad Ershad captured 
power through a bloodless coup and declared martial law. In 1983, Hasina formed the 15-party alliance 
to launch a movement to oust him from power. She was in and out of prison throughout the 1980s. Her party, 
along with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by Rahman's widow Khaleda Zia, was instrumental in the 
movement against the military rule. In 1984, Hasina was put under house arrest in February and then again 
in November. In March 1985, she was put under house arrest for three months.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1990, Hasina's 
8 party alliance was instrumental along with another BNP-led alliance in finally removing the Ershad 
regime. Under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina, Awami League formed an alliance with Ershad's Jayiya Party 
in 2006[PARAGRAPH:1]On July 16, 2007 Hasina was arrested by state police at her home and taken before 
a local court in Dhaka. She was accused of extortion and denied bail on the same day, and was held in 
a building converted into a jail on the premises of the National Parliament. According to the Awami League, 
the arrest was politically motivated. On June 11, 2008 Hasina was released on parole for medical reasons 
and the next day she flew to the United States to be treated for hearing impairment, eye problems and 
high blood pressure. Prof. Syed Modasser Ali, her personal physician, threatened to sue the caretaker 
government over negligence regarding Hasina's treatment during her detention.[PARAGRAPH:1]In November 
6, 2008 Hasina returned to Bangladesh to lead her party in general elections scheduled for December 29, 
2008. On December 11, 2008 Sheikh Hasina announced her party's election manifesto during a news conference.In
