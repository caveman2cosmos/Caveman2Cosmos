		<English>[TAB]Iran, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran, is a country in Western Asia. It is bordered 
to the northwest by Armenia, the de facto independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; with 
Kazakhstan and Russia across the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan 
and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. 
Comprising a land area of 1,648,195 km2 (636,372 sq mi), it is the second-largest nation in the Middle 
East and the 18th-largest in the world; with 78.4 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th most 
populous nation. It is the only country that has both a Caspian Sea and Indian Ocean coastline. Iran 
has long been of geostrategic importance because of its central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, 
and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz.</English>

Moosavi Khomeini was an Iranian Mujtahid , revolutionary, politician, the founder of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran as the first Islamic government in the modern age and the leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution 
which saw the overthrow of the Pahlavi monarchy and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran who was supported 
by the United States. Following the revolution, Khomeini became the country's Supreme Leader, a position 
created in the constitution of the Islamic Republic as the highest-ranking political and religious authority 
of the nation, which he held until his death. He was succeeded by Ali Khamenei. Khomeini was a Mujtahid 
or faqih (an expert in Islamic law) and author of more than 40 books, but he is primarily known for his 
political activities. He spent more than 15 years in exile for his opposition to the last Shah. In his 
writings and preachings he expanded the theory of velayat-e faqih, the "guardianship of the jurisconsult 
(clerical authority)", to include theocratic political rule by Islamic jurists. This principle was appended 
to the new Iranian constitution[13] after being put to a referendum.</English>
