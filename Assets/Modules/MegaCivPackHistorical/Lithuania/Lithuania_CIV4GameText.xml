		<English>[TAB]First mentioned in a medieval German manuscript, the Quedlinburg Chronicle, on February 
14, 1009, Lithuania entered into the annals of European history. The official coronation of Mindaugas 
as King of Lithuania, on July 6, 1253, marked its recognition by Christendom, and the birth of the Lithuanian 
State. Heretofore, warring Dukes made unity difficult, but they were finally able to come together and 
become unified enough to support his reign. Later during the early period of the Gediminids (Lithuanian 
Gediminaiciai),(1316-1430, the State grew into the multi-ethnic Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which also 
incorporated the territories of present day Belarus, Poland, Ukraine, and parts of Russia. Lithuanian 
rulers officially accepted Christianity in 1385, as a result of Poland offering Jogaila, the crown of 
Poland. By the 15th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania stretched across Eastern Europe, from the Baltic, 
to the Black Sea.[PARAGRAPH:2]When Grand Duke Jogaila was crowned King of Poland on February 2, 1386, 
Lithuania and Poland were joined into a personal union, as both countries were ruled by the same Jagiellon 
dynasty, Lithuanian Jogailaiciai. In 1401, the formal union was dissolved on diputes over legal terminology, 
and Vytautas, the cousin of Jogaila became the Grand Duke of Lithuania. Circa 1429 Vytautas had been 
granted a crown from Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, but Polish magnates prevented the crown get to Vytautas. 
He died waiting for the second crown sent by Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1447, the personal union 
was renewed. In 1569, Poland and Lithuania formally were united into a single State called the Polish-Lithuanian 
Commonwealth. Lithuania retained most of its symbols of Statehood. In 1795, the Commonwealth was dissolved 
by the third Partition of Poland, which forfeited its lands to Russia, Prussia and Austria, under duress. 
Over ninety percent of Lithuania was incorporated into the Russian Empire and, the remainder into Prussia.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 
1940, at the beginning of World War II, the Soviet Union occupied and annexed Lithuania in accordance 
with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Fifty years of communist rule ended with the advent of perestroika 
and glasnost. By the time Lithuania, led by Sajudis, an anti-communist and anti-Soviet independence movement, 
proclaimed its renewed independence on March 11, 1990. Lithuania was the first Soviet republic to do 
so, though Soviet forces unsuccessfully tried until August 1991 to suppress this secession, including 
an attack at Vilnius TV Tower on the night of January 13, 1991 that resulted in the death of 13 Lithuanian 
civilians. The last Russian troops left Lithuania on August 31, 1993.</English>
