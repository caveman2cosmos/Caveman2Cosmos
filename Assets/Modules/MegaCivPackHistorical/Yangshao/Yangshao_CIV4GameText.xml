		<English>[TAB]The Yangshao culture was a Neolithic culture that existed extensively along the central Yellow River in China. The Yangshao culture is dated from around 5000 BC to 3000 BC. The culture is named after Yangshao, the first excavated representative village of this culture, which was discovered in 1921 in Henan Province. The culture flourished mainly in the provinces of Henan, Shaanxi and Shanxi.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Yangshao people cultivated millet extensively; some villages also cultivated wheat or rice. They kept such animals as pigs and dogs, as well as sheep, goats, and cattle, but much of their meat came from hunting and fishing. Their stone tools were polished and highly specialized. The Yangshao people may also have practiced an early form of silkworm cultivation.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Yangshao culture is well-known for its painted pottery. Yangshao artisans created fine white, red, and black painted pottery with human facial, animal, and geometric designs. Unlike the later Longshan culture, the Yangshao culture did not use pottery wheels in pottery-making. Excavations found that children were buried in painted pottery jars.</English>

		<English>[H1]Yu the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Legendary Founder of the Xia Dynasty[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.2000 BC [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Yu the Great was the first ruler and founder of the Xia Dynasty. Occasionally identified as one of The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, he is best remembered for teaching the people flood control techniques to tame China's rivers and lakes. Yu established his capital at Yang City. On the second year of his regime, the prime minister of the previous king of Shun died. On the 5th year, he held the first meeting with all the leaders of states at Tushan. On the 8th year, he held the second meeting with all the leaders of states at Kuaiji and in order to reinforce his throne, he killed one of northern state leader, Fangfeng.[PARAGRAPH:1]During China's Great Flood Yu's father, Gun, was assigned by King Yao to tame the raging waters. Gun built earthen dikes all over the land in hopes of containing the waters. But the earthen dikes collapsed everywhere, and the project failed miserably. Gun was executed by King Shun to whom Yao had meanwhile handed the rulership. Shun recruited Yu as successor to his father's job at flood-control. But instead of building more dikes, Yu began to dredge out new river channels, to serve both as outlets for the torrential waters, and as irrigation conduits to distant farm lands. Yu spent a backbreaking thirteen years at this task, with the help of some 20,000 workers.[PARAGRAPH:1]Not only for this engineering feat, Yu has been remembered as examplar of perseverance and determination, and revered as the perfect civil servant. Stories continue to dwell on his single-minded dedication, where in spite of passing his own house three times in the thirteen years, he never once stopped in for a family visit \97 reasoning that a personal reunion would take time and mind away from the public crisis at hand.[PARAGRAPH:1]King Shun was so impressed by Yu's engineering and by his diligence that he passed the throne to Yu instead of to his own son, following King Yao's example in meritocracy. At the end of Great Yu's life, however, his ministers argued in favour of handing the kingship on to Yu's son, Qi, instituting a hereditary monarchy, and thus gave birth to China's first hereditary dynasty, the Xia Dynasty (ca.2700-1060).[PARAGRAPH:1]According to historical texts, Yu died at Mount Kuaiji (south of present day Shaoxing) whilst on a hunting tour on the southern frontier of his empire, and was buried there, where a mausoleum was built in his honor. A number of emperors in imperial times have travelled there to perform ceremonies in his honour, notably Qin Shi Huang. A temple, Dayu Ling, has been built on the traditional site where the ceremonies are performed. He ruled China for 45 years according to Bamboo Annals.</English>
