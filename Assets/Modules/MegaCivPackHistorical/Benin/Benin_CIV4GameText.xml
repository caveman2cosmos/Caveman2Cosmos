		<English>[TAB]The Benin Empire or Edo Empire was a large pre-colonial African state of modern Nigeria. 
According to one traditional account, the original people and founders of the Benin Empire, the Bini, 
were initially ruled by the Ogisos (Kings of the Sky). The city of Ibinu (later called Benin City) was 
founded in 1180 AD. About 36 known Ogiso are accounted for as rulers of the empire. [PARAGRAPH:2]Oranmiyan, 
the son of Ekaladerhan aka Oduduwa, agreed to go to Benin. He spent some years in Benin and came back 
to Ife after his wife gave birth to a son named Eweka. Eweka I became the first Oba of Benin. In 1440, 
Oba Ewuare (Ewuare the Great) came to power and turned the city-state into an empire. Around 1470, he 
named the new state Edo. The Oba had become the paramount power within the region. Oba Ewuare, the first 
Golden Age Oba, is credited with turning Benin City into a military fortress protected by moats and walls. 
It was from this bastion that he launched his military campaigns and began the expansion of the kingdom 
from the Edo-speaking heartlands. The lands of Idah, Owo, Akure all came under the central authority 
of the Edo Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]At its maximum extent the empire is claimed by the Edos to have extended 
from Onitsha in the east, through the forested southwestern region of Nigeria and into the present-day 
nation of Ghana. The Ga peoples of Ghana trace their ancestry to the ancient Kingdom of Benin. The state 
developed an advanced artistic culture especially in its famous artifacts of bronze, iron and ivory. 
These include bronze wall plaques and life-sized bronze heads of the Obas of Benin. The most common artifact 
is based on Queen Idia, porpularly called the FESTAC mask. Benin grew increasingly rich during the 16th 
and 17th centuries on the slave trade with Europe; slaves from enemy states of the interior were sold, 
and carried to the Americas in Dutch and Portuguese ships. The Bight of Benin's shore soon came to be 
known as the "Slave Coast."[PARAGRAPH:2]The city and empire of Benin declined after 1700, but revived 
in the 19th century with the development of the trade in palm oil, enslaved captives, and textiles. To 
preserve Benin's independence, bit by bit the Oba banned the export of goods from Benin, until the trade 
was exclusively in palm oil.[PARAGRAPH:2]Benin resisted signing a protectorate treaty with Great Britain 
through most of the 1880s and 1890s. However, after the slaying of eight British representatives in Benin 
territory, a 'Punitive Expedition' was launched in 1897, in which a British force, under the command 
of Admiral Sir Harry Rawson, conquered and burned the city, destroying much of the country’s treasured 
art and dispersing nearly all that remained. The portrait figures, busts, and groups created in iron, 
carved ivory, and especially in brass (conventionally called the "Benin Bronzes") made in Benin are now 
displayed in museums around the world.</English>

- 1480 2003[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Oba Ewuare was the greatest warrior 
legend and the most outstanding king in the history of Benin Empire. The title Ewuare (Oworuare), meaning 
it is cool or the trouble has ceased, and as a result the war is over. The title symbolizes an epoch 
of reconciliation, reconstruction and the return of peace among the warring factions in Benin between 
1435-1440 AD.[PARAGRAPH:1]Oba Ewuare ruled Benin kingdom between 1440-1473 AD. His reign marked the beginning 
of recovery and reform which opened up the pathway to the power and advancement of Benin Kingdom and 
the emergence of Benin Empire in the fifteen century. Ewuare’s political intelligence, unmatched by any
