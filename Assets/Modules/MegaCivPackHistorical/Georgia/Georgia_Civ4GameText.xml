[\BOLD]1967 - [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Saakashvili became President 
of Georgia on 25 January 2004 after President Eduard Shevardnadze resigned in a November 2003 bloodless 
"Rose Revolution" led by Saakashvili and his political allies, Nino Burjanadze and Zurab Zhvania. He 
was re-elected in the early Georgian presidential election of 5 January 2008. He is widely regarded as 
a pro-Western leader who has spearheaded a series of political and economical reforms, but has been criticized 
for authoritarian tendencies and worsening human rights record in the country. Opposition parties have 
also accused him of rigging elections and using riot police to crush opposition rallies.[PARAGRAPH:1]Saakashvili's 
"storming of Georgia's parliament" in 2003 put U.S. diplomats off guard. He ousted a leader the U.S. 
had long backed, Eduard Shevardnadze. Seeking support, Saakashvili went outside the U.S. State Department. 
He hired Randy Scheunemann, now Sen. McCain's top foreign-policy adviser, as a lobbyist and used Daniel 
Kunin of USAID and the NDI as a full-time adviser[PARAGRAPH:1]In the first months of his presidency, 
Saakashvili faced a major political crisis in the southwestern Autonomous Republic of Adjara run by an 
authoritarian regional leader, Aslan Abashidze, who largely ignored the central Georgian government and 
was viewed by many as a pro-Russian politician. The crisis threatened to develop into an armed confrontation, 
but Saakashvili's government managed to resolve the conflict peacefully, forcing Abashidze to resign 
on 6 May 2004. Success in Adjara encouraged the new president to intensify his efforts towards bringing 
the breakaway South Ossetia back under the Georgian jurisdiction. The separatist authorities responded 
with intense militarization in the region, that led to armed clashes in August 2004. A stalemate ensued, 
and despite a new peace plan proposed by the Georgian government in 2005, the conflict remains unresolved. 
Recently, in late July 2006, Saakashvili's government managed to deal successfully with another major 
crisis, this time in Abkhazia's Kodori Gorge where Georgia's police forces disarmed a defiant militia 
led by a local warlord Emzar Kvitsiani.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although the reforms initiated by President Saakashvili 
are considered to have mixed success, still the rate of corruption in the country has drastically reduced. 
According to the World Bank accounts, Georgia is named as the number one economic reformer in the world 
and the country ranks as 18 in term of ease of doing business, when most of the country's neighbours' 
are in the 100s of the World Bank's rank.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Evidence for the earliest occupation of the territory of present day Georgia goes back 
to ca. 1.8 million years ago, as evident from the excavations of Dmanisi in the south-eastern part of 
the country. Later prehistoric remains (Acheulian, Mousterian and the Upper Palaeolithic) are known from 
numerous cave and open-air sites in Georgia. The earliest agricultural Neolithic occupation is dated 
sometime between 6000 and 5000 B.C. known as the Shulaveri-Shomu culture, where people used local obsidian 
for tools, raised animals such as cattle and pigs, and grow crops, including grapes.[PARAGRAPH:2]The 
history of Georgia can be traced back to the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia, and it was one of 
the first countries to adopt Christianity as an official religion, early in the 4th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]Between 
2100 and 750 B.C., the area survived the invasions by the Hittites, Urartians, Medes, Proto-Persians 
and Cimmerians.The first two Georgian states emerged in the west known as the Kingdom of Colchis and 
in the east as the Kingdom of Iberia.[PARAGRAPH:2]A second Georgian tribal union emerged in the 13th 
century BC on the Black Sea coast under the Kingdom of Colchis in western Georgia.The ancient Greeks 
knew of Colchis, and it featured in the Greek legend of Jason and the Argonauts, who travelled there 
in search of the Golden Fleece. In the eastern part of Georgia there was a struggle for the leadership 
among the various Georgian confederations during the 6th – 4th centuries BC which was finally won by 
the Kartlian tribes from the region of Mtskheta. According to the Georgian tradition, the Kingdom of 
Kartli (known as Iberia in the Greek-Roman literature) was founded around 300 BC by Parnavaz I, the first 
ruler of the Parnavazid dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:2] At the beginning of the 19th century Georgia became a part 
of the Russian Empire. After a brief period of independence following the Russian Revolution of 1917, 
Georgia was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1922.[PARAGRAPH:2]Independence was restored 
in 1991. Like many post-communist countries Georgia suffered from the economic crisis and civil unrest 
during the 1990s. After the bloodless Rose Revolution, however, the new leadership has established efficient 
government institutions, reformed the economy and guided the country through a period of the fastest 
economic growth in its history.[PARAGRAPH:2]Georgia is a representative democracy, organized as a secular, 
unitary semi-presidential republic; however the idea to restore the constitutional monarchy is popular 
in certain circles, most notably in the Georgian Orthodox Church It is currently a member of the United 
Nations, the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization, the Organization of the Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation, and GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development. The country seeks to join 
NATO and, in the longer term, accession to the European Union.[PARAGRAPH:2]In August 2008, Georgia engaged 
in an armed conflict with Russia and separatist groups from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In the aftermath 
of the conflict Russia recognized the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states, 
but at present only Nicaragua, the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, and the de facto independent republic 
of Transnistria have followed suit. On August 28, 2008, the Parliament of Georgia passed a resolution 
declaring Abkhazia and South Ossetia "Russian-occupied territories".</English>

in the east as the Kingdom of Iberia.[PARAGRAPH:2]A second Georgian tribal union emerged in the 13th 
century BC on the Black Sea coast under the Kingdom of Colchis in western Georgia.The ancient Greeks 
knew of Colchis, and it featured in the Greek legend of Jason and the Argonauts, who travelled there 
in search of the Golden Fleece. In the eastern part of Georgia there was a struggle for the leadership 
among the various Georgian confederations during the 6th – 4th centuries BC which was finally won by 
the Kartlian tribes from the region of Mtskheta. According to the Georgian tradition, the Kingdom of 
Kartli (known as Iberia in the Greek-Roman literature) was founded around 300 BC by Parnavaz I, the first 
ruler of the Parnavazid dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:2] At the beginning of the 19th century Georgia became a part 
of the Russian Empire. After a brief period of independence following the Russian Revolution of 1917, 
Georgia was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1922.[PARAGRAPH:2]Independence was restored 
in 1991. Like many post-communist countries Georgia suffered from the economic crisis and civil unrest 
during the 1990s. After the bloodless Rose Revolution, however, the new leadership has established efficient 
government institutions, reformed the economy and guided the country through a period of the fastest 
economic growth in its history.[PARAGRAPH:2]Georgia is a representative democracy, organized as a secular, 
unitary semi-presidential republic; however the idea to restore the constitutional monarchy is popular 
in certain circles, most notably in the Georgian Orthodox Church It is currently a member of the United 
Nations, the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization, the Organization of the Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation, and GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development. The country seeks to join 
NATO and, in the longer term, accession to the European Union.[PARAGRAPH:2]In August 2008, Georgia engaged 
in an armed conflict with Russia and separatist groups from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In the aftermath 
of the conflict Russia recognized the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states, 
but at present only Nicaragua, the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, and the de facto independent republic 
of Transnistria have followed suit. On August 28, 2008, the Parliament of Georgia passed a resolution 
declaring Abkhazia and South Ossetia "Russian-occupied territories".</Spanish>
