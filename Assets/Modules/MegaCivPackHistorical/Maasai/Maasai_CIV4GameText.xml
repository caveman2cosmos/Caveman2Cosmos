		<English>[H1]Mbatian[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Great Laibon of the Maasai[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 
1820 - 1890[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]According to Maasai oral tradition, 
the C19 was a period when two charismatic Prophets, Supeet and Mbatian, had a dominant influence and 
they were largely responsible to unifying Maasai moran against powerful enemies. This suggests that the 
policy of unification sought to build up altruism and group indulgence as amanyata virtue that overrode 
family feuds and clan hostilities in the interests of Maasai dominance throughout the region. [PARAGRAPH:1]His 
reputation as a medicine man and prophet earned him the title of the Great Laibon. He lived at the dawn 
of the white man's entry into central Africa, at a time when the Maasai were perhaps at the peak of their 
formidable strength. But Mbatian was tormented by terrible visions. He called the Maasai elders together 
and said to them, 'I am about to die. I see a large black rhino cutting a line across the land. There 
are pink men on his back. I see the end of my children and of the land. Do not move from your land, for 
if you do you will die of a terrible unknown disease, your cattle will perish, you will fight with a 
powerful enemy and you will be beaten.' [PARAGRAPH:1] In 1890 Mbatian, the Maasai Oloiboni (the ritual 
expert) had died leaving his succession in dispute between his two sons - Senteu and Olonana. The Great 
Laibon was succeeded by his son, Lenana, who promised his people that by giving some of their best land 
to the white man, they would appease the invaders and avoid further tragedy. He was wrong.[PARAGRAPH:1]If 
this brief history conveys an impression of a sweeping migration, coming like a storm, wild and full 
of quick destruction and plunder, it has misled. The Maasai's progress was a drift rather than a drive. 
They trod softly rather than thundered. But the demands of their cattle were paramount and all who resisted 
perished. The destruction of their enemies was total; their progress like the flow of molten rock from 
an ancient volcano: slow, deadly, irresistible. They pushed all before them until the Maasai territory 
stretched from the Indian Ocean to the great lakes, from the snows of Kilimanjaro to the edges of the 
Sudanese wastelands.  (picture: Maasai warrior used to represent Mbatian)</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Maasai or Masai, an indigenous African tribe of semi-nomadic people located primarily 
in Kenya and northern Tanzania, are probably one of the most familiar tribes of East Africa. Despite 
the growth of modern civilization, the Maasai have largely managed to maintain their traditional ways, 
although this becomes more challenging each year.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Maasai are part of the Nilotic family 
of African tribal groups, and probably migrated from the Nile valley in Sudan to central and south-western 
Kenya and northern Tanzania sometime after 1500 AD, bringing their domesticated cattle with them. They 
are linguistically and well as physically related to the Samburu, Turkana and Kalenjin, among others.[PARAGRAPH:2]After 
migrating South from the Nile Region of North Africa, in the fifteenth century the Maasai established 
themselves in the East of Africa by the mid seventeenth century. Along the way they conquered such groups 
as the Chaga, Sirikwa, Galla, Iltatua, Ndorobo and Kikuyu.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite their reputation as fierce 
warriors, Maasai culture revolves around their cattle. One of their spiritual beliefs is that their rain 
god Ngai gave all cattle to the Maasai people, and therefore anyone else who possesses cattle must have 
stolen them from the Maasai. This has led to some fatal altercations with other tribes of the regions 
over the centuries when the Maasai attempt to reclaim their "property". The huts of the Maasai are built 
from dried cattle dung, and certain sacred rituals involve the drinking of cow blood.[PARAGRAPH:2]Legend 
has it that long ago the Maasai were divided into two groups during a season of drought. Before this 
time they lived as one group in a crater-like region surrounded by steep escarpments. They spoke one 
language called olmaa and had no subdivisions as they do today. However, when no rains fell they decided 
they had to move into the hills where the land was vast and fertile. When a bridge had been built and 
the families with their cattle began to ascend the bridge suddenly broke. Those who were crossing fell 
back into the crater where many more awaited. However, half of the people had already reached the top. 
These people at the top became ilmeek or non-Maasai. Those in the crater remained Maasai.[PARAGRAPH:2]The 
ability to graze their cattle over large territories has diminished considerably in recent years, due 
to increased urbanisation and the declaration of the Maasai Mara and Serengeti game reserves, which was 
all formerly Maasai grazing land.[PARAGRAPH:2]A dispute between two brothers, one a religious leader 
and the other a secular chief in the mid nineteenth century, caused a rift among the people. A civil 
war entailed as British colonists began to take an interest in Maasai territory siding with the religious 
leader. Along with disease and famine, the people were weakened. The British displaced the Maasai to 
reservations where terrain was less than adequate for sustenance.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although their number slowly 
grows each year, the Maasai don't command the authority and presence they once did in Africa. After independence, 
some Maasai were able to return to their family homeland. By this time many Maasai had become more settled. 
Some started growing crops or held jobs requiring them to stay.[PARAGRAPH2]There are numerous traditions 
and ceremonies performed by Maasai men. Perhaps best known is the warrior "jumping" dance, where young 
Maasai morani (warrior-youth) leap into the air from a standing position, in order to demonstrate their 
strength and agility. Until recent times, in order to earn the right to have a wife, a Maasai moran was 
required to have killed a lion. Officially this practice has stopped, although there is evidence that 
it continues in the more remote regions of Kenya. Also in earlier times a group of young boys were required 
to build a new village and live in it for a lengthy period (often years) as part of the passage to manhood. 
This practice is dying out due to lack of land.</English>

stolen them from the Maasai. This has led to some fatal altercations with other tribes of the regions 
over the centuries when the Maasai attempt to reclaim their "property". The huts of the Maasai are built 
from dried cattle dung, and certain sacred rituals involve the drinking of cow blood.[PARAGRAPH:2]Legend 
has it that long ago the Maasai were divided into two groups during a season of drought. Before this 
time they lived as one group in a crater-like region surrounded by steep escarpments. They spoke one 
language called olmaa and had no subdivisions as they do today. However, when no rains fell they decided 
they had to move into the hills where the land was vast and fertile. When a bridge had been built and 
the families with their cattle began to ascend the bridge suddenly broke. Those who were crossing fell 
back into the crater where many more awaited. However, half of the people had already reached the top. 
These people at the top became ilmeek or non-Maasai. Those in the crater remained Maasai.[PARAGRAPH:2]The 
ability to graze their cattle over large territories has diminished considerably in recent years, due 
to increased urbanisation and the declaration of the Maasai Mara and Serengeti game reserves, which was 
all formerly Maasai grazing land.[PARAGRAPH:2]A dispute between two brothers, one a religious leader 
and the other a secular chief in the mid nineteenth century, caused a rift among the people. A civil 
war entailed as British colonists began to take an interest in Maasai territory siding with the religious 
leader. Along with disease and famine, the people were weakened. The British displaced the Maasai to 
reservations where terrain was less than adequate for sustenance.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although their number slowly 
grows each year, the Maasai don't command the authority and presence they once did in Africa. After independence, 
some Maasai were able to return to their family homeland. By this time many Maasai had become more settled. 
Some started growing crops or held jobs requiring them to stay.[PARAGRAPH2]There are numerous traditions 
and ceremonies performed by Maasai men. Perhaps best known is the warrior "jumping" dance, where young 
Maasai morani (warrior-youth) leap into the air from a standing position, in order to demonstrate their 
strength and agility. Until recent times, in order to earn the right to have a wife, a Maasai moran was 
required to have killed a lion. Officially this practice has stopped, although there is evidence that 
it continues in the more remote regions of Kenya. Also in earlier times a group of young boys were required 
to build a new village and live in it for a lengthy period (often years) as part of the passage to manhood. 
This practice is dying out due to lack of land.</Spanish>
