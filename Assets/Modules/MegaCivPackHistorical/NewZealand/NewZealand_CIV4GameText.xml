		<English>[TAB]New Zealand is a country in the south-western Pacific Ocean comprising two large islands 
(the North Island and the South Island) and numerous smaller islands, most notably Stewart Island/Rakiura 
and the Chatham Islands. The indigenous Maori named New Zealand Aotearoa, which is usually translated 
into English as The Land of the Long White Cloud. The Realm of New Zealand also includes the Cook Islands 
and Niue, which are self-governing but in free association; Tokelau; and the Ross Dependency (New Zealand's 
territorial claim in Antarctica).[PARAGRAPH:2]New Zealand is notable for its geographic isolation, being 
separated from Australia to the northwest by the Tasman Sea, approximately 2000 kilometres (1250 miles) 
across. Its closest neighbours to the north are New Caledonia, Fiji and Tonga.[PARAGRAPH:2]The population 
is mostly of European descent, with the indigenous Maori being the largest minority. Asians and non-Maori 
Polynesians are also significant minorities, especially in the cities. Elizabeth II, as the Queen of 
New Zealand, is the Head of State and, in her absence, is represented by a non-partisan Governor-General. 
The Queen 'reigns but does not rule.' She has no real political influence, and her position is largely 
symbolic.[2] Political power is held by the democratically-elected Parliament of New Zealand under the 
leadership of the Prime Minister, who is the Head of Government.</English>

		<English>[H1]Helen Clark[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of New Zealand[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: 
[\BOLD] 1950 - [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Clark grew up as the eldest 
of four daughters of a Waikato farming family. Her mother, Margaret, worked as a primary-school teacher 
and her father, George, was a farmer who supported the National Party at the 1981 election. Clark studied 
at Te Pahu Primary School, at Epsom Girls' Grammar School in Auckland and at the University of Auckland, 
where she majored in politics and graduated with a MA (Honours) in 1974. Her thesis research focused 
on rural political behaviour and representation.[PARAGRAPH:1]When the New Zealand Labour Party came into 
office as part of a coalition following the 1999 election, Clark became the second female Prime Minister 
of New Zealand and the first to have won office at an election. (The previous Prime Minister, Jenny Shipley 
took office as the result of a mid-term party leadership challenge.) During her term in office, a number 
of prominent offices have been held by females - such as the Queen, Governor-General, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives and Chief Justice.[PARAGRAPH:1]Clark has held the positions of Prime Minister 
and of Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage from 1999 until the present. She also has ministerial 
responsibility for the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service and for Ministerial Services.[PARAGRAPH:1]Clark's 
government has brought in significant changes to the welfare system, such as child tax credits in the 
Working for Families package. Her government has also changed industrial-relations law and raised the 
minimum wage six times in as many years. Changes have also occurred in tertiary-education financing, 
with the abolition of interest on student-loans — firstly for those currently studying, then extended 
to all borrowers living in New Zealand. Other changes introduced during Clark's term in office include 
legal provision for civil unions, the introduction of 14 weeks' paid parental leave, and the Property 
(Relationships) Act.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even though some commentators saw stable government within the relatively 
new MMP electoral system as unlikely, Clark's supporters credit her with maintaining two terms of stable 
MMP government, as well as being able to form the current government given the close election result. 
In 2005, Forbes ranked Clark as number 24 of "The 100 Most Powerful Women" in the world.</English>
