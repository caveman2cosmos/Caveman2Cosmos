		<English>[TAB]In ancient geography, especially in Roman sources, Dacia was the land inhabited by the 
Dacians. The Greeks referred to them as the Getae, which were specifically a branch of the Thracians 
north of the Haemus range. Dacia was bounded in the south approximately by the Danubius river (Danube), 
in Greek sources the Istros, or at its greatest extent, by the Haemus Mons (the Balkan Mountains). Moesia 
(Dobrogea), a region south of the Danube, was a core area where the Getae lived and interacted with the 
Ancient Greeks. In the east it was bounded by the Pontus Euxinus (Black Sea) and the river Danastris 
(Dniester), in Greek sources the Tyras. But several Dacian settlements are recorded between the rivers 
Dniester and Hypanis (Southern Bug), and the Tisia (Tisza) to the west. At times Dacia included areas 
between the Tisa and the Middle Danube. The Carpathian Mountains were located in the middle of Dacia. 
It thus corresponds to the present day countries of Romania and Moldova, as well as smaller parts of 
Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, and Ukraine. Dacians (or Getae) were North Thracian tribes. Dacian tribes 
had both peaceful and military encounters with other neighboring tribes, such as Sarmatians, Scythians, 
and Celts. A Dacian Kingdom of variable size existed between 82 BC until the Roman conquest in AD 106. 
The capital of Dacia, Sarmizegetusa, located in modern Romania, was destroyed by the Romans, but its 
name was added to that of the new city (Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa) built by the latter to serve as 
the capital of the Roman province of Dacia.</English>

AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Decebalus (ruled 87-106) was the last king 
of Dacia. He is famous for fighting three wars, with varying success, against the Roman Empire under 
two emperors. After raiding across the Danube, he defeated a Roman invasion in the reign of Domitian, 
securing a period of independence during which Decebalus consolidated his power. When Trajan came to 
power, he invaded Dacia to weaken its threat to Roman border territory. Decebalus was defeated. He remained 
in power as a client king, but continued to assert his independence, leading to a final and overwhelming 
Roman invasion in 105. Trajan reduced the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa in 106, absorbing Dacia into the 
Empire. Decebalus committed suicide to avoid capture. Since the mid 19th century Decebalus has been portrayed 
as a national hero in Romania, the modern successor to ancient Dacia. There are several monuments depicting 
him.</English>
