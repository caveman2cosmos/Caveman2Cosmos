		<English>[TAB]Kazakhstan has been inhabited since the Stone Age: the region's climate and terrain are 
best suited for nomads practicing pastoralism. Historians believe that humans first domesticated the 
horse in the region's vast steppes. While ancient cities Taraz (Aulie-Ata) and Hazrat-e Turkestan had 
long served as important way-stations along the Silk Road connecting East and West, real political consolidation 
only began with the Mongol invasion of the early 13th century. Under the Mongol Empire, administrative 
districts were established, and these eventually came under the emergent Kazakh Khanate.[PARAGRAPH:2]During 
the 17th century Kazakhs fought Oirats, a federation of western Mongol tribes, among which the Dzungars 
were particularly aggressive. The beginning of the 18th century marked the zenith of the Kazakh Khanate. 
During this period the Little Horde participated in the 1723-1730 war against the Dzungars, following 
their "Great Disaster" invasion of Kazakh territories. Under leadership Abul Khair Khan the Kazakhs won 
major victories over the Dzungar at the Bulanty River, in 1726, and at the Battle of Anrakay in 1729.Ablai 
Khan participated in the most significant battles against the Dzungars from the 1720s to the 1750s, for 
which he was declared a "batyr" ("hero") by the people. Kazakhs were also a victims of constant raids 
carried out by the Volga Kalmyks.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Russian Empire introduced a system of administration 
and built military garrisons and barracks in its effort to establish a presence in Central Asia in the 
so-called "Great Game" between it and the British Empire. The first Russian outpost, Orsk, was built 
in 1735. Russia enforced the Russian language in all schools and governmental organisations. Russian 
efforts to impose its system aroused the extreme resentment by the Kazakh people, and by the 1860s, most 
Kazakhs resisted Russia's annexation largely because of the disruption it wrought upon the traditional 
nomadic lifestyle and livestock-based economy, and the associated hunger which was rapidly wiping out 
some Kazakh tribes. The Kazakh national movement, which began in the late 1800s, sought to preserve the 
native language and identity by resisting the attempts of the Russian Empire to assimilate and stifle 
them.[PARAGRAPH:2]Soviet repression of the traditional elite, along with forced collectivization in late 
1920s-1930s, brought mass hunger and led to unrest. Between 1926 and 1939, the Kazakh population declined 
by 22%, due to starvation, violence and mass emigration. Today, the estimates suggest that the population 
of Kazakhstan would be closer to 20 million if there had been no starvation or massacre of Kazakhs. During 
the 1930s, many renowned Kazakh writers, thinkers, poets, politicians and historians were slaughtered 
on Stalin's orders, both as part of the repression and as a methodical pattern of suppressing Kazakh 
identity and culture. The Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) contributed five national divisions 
to the Soviet Union's World War II effort.[PARAGRAPH:2]Caught up in the groundswell of Soviet republics 
seeking greater autonomy, Kazakhstan declared its sovereignty as a republic within the Union of Soviet 
Socialist Republics in October 1990. Following the August 1991 aborted coup attempt in Moscow and the 
subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan declared independence on December 16, 1991. It 
was the last of the Soviet republics to declare independence.[PARAGRAPH:2]The years following independence 
have been marked by significant reforms to the Soviet-style economy and political monopoly on power. 
Under Nursultan Nazarbayev, who initially came to power in 1989 as the head of the Communist Party of 
Kazakhstan and was eventually elected President in 1991, Kazakhstan has made significant progress toward 
developing a market economy. The country has enjoyed significant economic growth since 2000, partly due 
to its large oil, gas, and mineral reserves. Democracy, however, has not gained much ground since 1991.</English>

Khan belonged to the senior branch of descendants of the 15th century founder of the Kazakh state, Janybek 
Khan. In the first half of the 18th century, Ablai Khan proved to be a talented organizer and commander 
as he headed detachments of the Kazakh militia fighting the Dzungars. He participated in the most significant 
battles against the Dzungars from the 1720s to the 1750s, for which he was declared a "batyr" ("hero")

headed the unified forces of the Kazakhs and furthered the centralization of state power in Kazakhstan. 
Until his election as the khan of the three jüzes, Ablai had to compete with Khan Abul Mambet and his 
descendants of Middle jüz for leadership. Initially, Russia recognized Abul Mambet as the Khan of Middle 
jüz, while Ablai was supported by China. Ablai's talent in playing China against Russia gradually made 
him the unrivalled Khan of the steppe. Unlike Abul Khair Khan of Little jüz, Ablai never submitted to 
Russian rule. In 1771, at the meeting of the representatives of the three jüzes, Ablai was elected as 
the Kazakh khan. Russian Empress requested that the title of khan should be recognized and officially 
approved by Russia. To that end, she sent an official letter to Petropavl, where Ablai was expected to 
receive the title in 1779. He never showed up at the fort, declining Russia's request to appoint him 
as the khan of Middle jüz. In contrast to Ablai, other khans and sultans had been competing for the lavish 
gifts and stipends of the Emperors of Russia in return for their submission.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the Qing 
campaigns against the Dzungars, Ablai Khan chose not to take sides in the Dzungar-Chinese conflict. Once 
the conflict was settled, Ablai offered his submission to the Qianlong Emperor. Ablai was confirmed as 
Kazakh khan by both the Chinese and the Russians. He lead numerous campaigns against Kokand Khanate and 
Kyrgyzs. In the last campaign his troops liberated many cities in Southern Kazakhstan and even captured 
Tashkent. Then he procedeed to present day Kyrgyzstan and won the furious battle with troops of local 
warlords. Upon his death in 1781 he was interred in the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasavi in Hazrat-e Turkestan.</English>

headed the unified forces of the Kazakhs and furthered the centralization of state power in Kazakhstan. 
Until his election as the khan of the three jüzes, Ablai had to compete with Khan Abul Mambet and his 
descendants of Middle jüz for leadership. Initially, Russia recognized Abul Mambet as the Khan of Middle 
jüz, while Ablai was supported by China. Ablai's talent in playing China against Russia gradually made 
him the unrivalled Khan of the steppe. Unlike Abul Khair Khan of Little jüz, Ablai never submitted to 
Russian rule. In 1771, at the meeting of the representatives of the three jüzes, Ablai was elected as 
the Kazakh khan. Russian Empress requested that the title of khan should be recognized and officially 
approved by Russia. To that end, she sent an official letter to Petropavl, where Ablai was expected to 
receive the title in 1779. He never showed up at the fort, declining Russia's request to appoint him 
as the khan of Middle jüz. In contrast to Ablai, other khans and sultans had been competing for the lavish 
gifts and stipends of the Emperors of Russia in return for their submission.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the Qing 
campaigns against the Dzungars, Ablai Khan chose not to take sides in the Dzungar-Chinese conflict. Once 
the conflict was settled, Ablai offered his submission to the Qianlong Emperor. Ablai was confirmed as 
Kazakh khan by both the Chinese and the Russians. He lead numerous campaigns against Kokand Khanate and 
Kyrgyzs. In the last campaign his troops liberated many cities in Southern Kazakhstan and even captured 
Tashkent. Then he procedeed to present day Kyrgyzstan and won the furious battle with troops of local 
warlords. Upon his death in 1781 he was interred in the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasavi in Hazrat-e Turkestan.</Italian>

Khan. In the first half of the 18th century, Ablai Khan proved to be a talented organizer and commander 
as he headed detachments of the Kazakh militia fighting the Dzungars. He participated in the most significant 
battles against the Dzungars from the 1720s to the 1750s, for which he was declared a "batyr" ("hero") 
by the people.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ablai's activity aimed to create a strong and independent Kazakh state. He
