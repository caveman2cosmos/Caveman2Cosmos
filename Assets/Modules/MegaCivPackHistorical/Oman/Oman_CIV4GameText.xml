		<English>[TAB]Oman, officially the Sultanate of Oman, is an Arab country in the southeastern coast 
of the Arabian Peninsula. Holding a strategically important position at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, 
the nation is bordered by the United Arab Emirates to the northwest, Saudi Arabia to the west, and Yemen 
to the southwest, and shares marine borders with Iran and Pakistan. The coast is formed by the Arabian 
Sea on the southeast and the Gulf of Oman on the northeast. The Madha and Musandam exclaves are surrounded 
by the UAE on their land borders, with the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman forming Musandam's coastal 
boundaries. From the late 17th century, the Omani Sultanate was a powerful empire, vying with Portugal 
and Britain for influence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. At its peak in the 19th century, Omani 
influence or control extended across the Strait of Hormuz to Iran and modern-day Pakistan, and as far 
south as Zanzibar (today part of Tanzania).[7] As its power declined in the 20th century, the sultanate 
came under the influence of the United Kingdom. Historically, Muscat was the principal trading port of 
the Persian Gulf region. Muscat was also among the most important trading ports of the Indian Ocean. 
Oman's official religion is Ibadi Islam.</English>

[\BOLD] born 18 November 1940[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Qaboos bin Said 
Al Said is the Sultan of Oman and its dependencies. He rose to power after overthrowing his father, Said 
bin Taimur, in a palace coup in 1970. He is the 14th-generation descendant of the founder of the Al Bu 
Sa'idi dynasty. After deposing his father in 1970, Sultan Qaboos opened up the country, embarked on economic 
reforms, and followed a policy of modernisation marked by increased spending on health, education and 
welfare. In 1981 Oman became a founding member of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. Political 
reforms were eventually introduced. Historically, voters had been chosen from among tribal leaders, intellectuals, 
and businessmen. In 1997 Sultan Qaboos decreed that women could vote for, and stand for election to, 
the Majlis al-Shura, the Consultative Assembly of Oman. Two women were duly elected to the body.</English>
