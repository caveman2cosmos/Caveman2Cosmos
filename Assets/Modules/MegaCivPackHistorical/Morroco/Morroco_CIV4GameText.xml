		<English>[TAB]The word 'maghreb' is an Arabic term literally meaning "place of setting (of the sun)", 
and hence "West." It derives from the root ghuroob, meaning "to set" or "to be hidden". Maghrebis are 
of mixed origins. They are mainly of Berber and/or Arab origins; the resulting mix is sometimes (particularly 
in Mauritania) termed Moorish. The Trans-Saharan trade brought in numerous West Africans, whose average 
contribution to the population increases as one goes south. In the northern coastal towns, conversely, 
several waves of European immigrants have influenced the population - notably Moriscos, Spanish Muslims 
who fled the Reconquista, Turks who came over with the Ottoman Empire, and French, Italians, Spanish, 
and others captured by the corsairs. Jewish communities have historically been present in the older cities, 
and have contributed to the wider gene pool through conversion. In Algeria especially, a large European 
minority, the "pied noirs", immigrated under French colonial rule; the overwhelming majority of these, 
however, left immediately following independence.[PARAGRAPH:2]From the end of the Ice Age, when the Sahara 
Desert dried up, contact between the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa was extremely limited by the difficulty 
in crossing the desert. This remained the case until after the time of the Arab expansion and the spread 
of Islam; even then, trans-Saharan trade was restricted to costly (but often profitable) caravan expeditions, 
trading such goods as salt, gold, ivory, and slaves.[PARAGRAPH:2]Originally, the Maghreb was inhabited 
by "Caucasoid" Cro-Magnoids (Iberomaurusians) in the north and by "Black" peoples in the Sahara. Later, 
about 8000 BC, there came from the east "Caucasoid" speakers of northern Afro-Asiatic languages such 
as Berber at least since the Capsian culture. Many ports along the Maghreb coast were occupied by Phoenicians, 
particularly Carthaginians; with the defeat of Carthage, many of these ports naturally passed to Rome, 
and ultimately it took control of the entire Maghreb north of the Atlas Mountains, apart from some of 
the most mountainous regions like the Moroccan Rif.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Arabs reached the Maghreb in early 
Umayyad times, but their control over it was quite weak, and various Islamic "heresies" such as the Ibadis 
and the Shia, adopted by some Berbers, quickly threw off Caliphal control in the name of their interpretations 
of Islam. The Arabic language became widespread only later, as a result of the invasion of the Banu Hilal 
(unleashed, ironically, by the Berber Fatimids in punishment for their Zirid clients' defection) in the 
1100's. Throughout this period, the Maghreb fluctuated between occasional unity (as under the Almohads, 
and briefly under the Hafsids) and more commonly division into three states roughly corresponding to 
modern Morocco, western Algeria, and eastern Algeria and Tunisia.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the Middle Ages, 
the area east of Morocco was loosely under the control of the Ottoman Empire. After the 19th century, 
it was colonized by France, Spain and later Italy. Today over two and a half million Maghrebins live 
in France, especially from Algeria, as well as many more French of Maghrebin origin.</English>

- 828 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Idris II was the son of Idris I, the

prophet Muhammad.[PARAGRAPH:1]The death of Idris I, and the resulting destabilisation of the fledgling

Rom Landau, says: "In the lore of the Moroccans, Idris II was a being of almost magical attributes. An 
exceptional young man he certainly must have been. At many points we are reminded of one of the greatest 
sages of Islam, Ibn Sina or Avicenna. At the age of four little Idris apparently could read, at five 
write, at eight he knew the Koran by heart, and by then is said to have mastered the wisdom of all the 
outstanding savants. He was of real physical strength as well, and when he became officially sovereign 
in 805 at the age of thirteen, he had already accomplished feats of endurance that men twice his age 
could not emulate. His profound Islamic faith enhanced all these advantages and increased the veneration 
accorded him."[PARAGRAPH:1]Twenty years after his father had done so, Idris II refounded the city Fez 
on the left bank of the river Fez, opposite to where his father had founded it on the right bank. From 
there on, Idris II began to unify Maghreb under Islam, establishing its firm allegiance to the belief. 
After spending 19 years pursuing such purposes, this prodigy died at 35 in 828. For twelve hundred years 
afterwards, the tradition of monarchy, established by Idris I and II, were continued.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>
