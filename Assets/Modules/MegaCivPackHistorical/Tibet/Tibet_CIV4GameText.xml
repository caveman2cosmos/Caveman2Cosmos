		<English>[TAB]Over the centuries the Yarlung Zangbo valley was the focus of ancient trade routes from India, China, and central Asia. Tibet emerged from an obscure history to flourish in the 7th cent. AD as an independent kingdom with its capital at Lhasa. Toward the end of the 12th century many Indian Buddhists, fleeing before the Muslim invasion, went to Tibet. In the 13th century Tibet fell under Mongol influence, which was to last until the 18th century. In 1270, Kublai Khan, emperor of China, was converted to Buddhism by the abbot of the Sakya lamasery. The abbot returned to Tibet to found the Sakya dynasty (1270-1340) and to become the first priest-king of Tibet. In 1720, the Ch'ing dynasty replaced Mongol rule in Tibet. 
China thereafter claimed suzerainty, often merely nominal.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the 18th century, British authorities in India attempted to establish relations with Lhasa, but Tibet maintained its traditional seclusion. Meanwhile, Ladakh, long part of Tibet, was lost to the rulers of Kashmir, and Sikkim was seized by Britain. In 1906, Britain recognized China's suzerainty over Tibet. However, the Tibetans were able to expel the Chinese from Tibet and reassert their independence (1912). After the death (1933) of the 13th Dalai Lama, Tibet gradually drifted back into the Chinese orbit. By a Tibetan-Chinese agreement (May, 1951), Tibet became a national autonomous region of China under the traditional rule of the Dalai Lama, but under the actual control of a Chinese Communist Commission.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Communist government introduced far-reaching land reforms and sharply curtailed the power of the monastic orders. Full-scale 
revolt broke out in March, 1959. The Chinese suppressed the rebellion, but the Dalai Lama managed to escape to India.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Chinese adopted brutal repressive measures, provoking charges from the Dalai Lama of genocide. Landholdings were seized, the lamaseries were virtually emptied, and thousands of monks were forced to find other work. In 1965 the Tibetan Autonomous Region was formally established. The Cultural Revolution, with its antireligious orientation, was disastrous for highly religious Tibet. Religious practices were banned and over 4,000 monasteries were destroyed. Though the ban was lifted in 1976 and some Buddhist temples have again been in operation since the early 1980s, Tibetans continue to complain of widespread discrimination by the Chinese. Several protests in Tibet in the late 1980s and early 1990s were violently suppressed by the Communist government and martial law was imposed in 1989. Demonstrations against Chinese rule have nevertheless continued. Moreover, in recent years other 
countries have increasingly raised the issue of human-rights violations in Tibet, and have pressured the Chinese government to moderate their stance in that region.</English>

Born at Gyama at Maldro to Namri Löntsen (Wylie: Gnam-ri-slon-mtshan), he is traditionally credited with bringing Buddhism to the Tibetan people.[PARAGRAPH:1]Songtsen Gampo was adept at diplomacy as well as on the field of battle. The king's minister Myang Mang-po-rje Zhang-shang defeated Sum pa circa 627. Six years later (c. 632/633) Myang Mang-po-rje Zhang-shang was accused of treason and executed. Minister Mgar-srong-rtsan succeeded him.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Chinese records record receiving an envoy in 634. On that occasion the king requested marriage to a Chinese princess and was refused. In 635/636 the emperor attacked and defeated the 'A zha people (Chinese: Tüyühün), who lived around Lake Koko Nor in the northeast corner of Tibet, and who controlled important trade routes into China. After a successful campaign against China in 635/6 the Chinese emperor agreed to marry Songtsen Gampo to a Chinese princess.[PARAGRAPH:1]In about 639, after Songtsen Gampo had had a dispute with his younger brother Brtsan srong, the younger brother was burnt to death by his own minister Mkha's sregs, presumably at the behest of the king.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Chinese princess Wencheng (Tibetan: Mung-chang Kungco), daughter of the powerful Emperor Taizong of Tang China, left China in 640 to marry Songtsen Gampo, arriving a year latter. Peace between China and Tibet prevailed for the remainder of Songtsen Gampo's reign.[PARAGRAPH:1]Songtsen Gampo's sister Sad-mar-kar was sent to marry Lig-myi-rhya, the king of Zhang-zhung. However, when the king refused to consummate the marriage, she then helped her brother to defeat Lig myi-rhya and to incorporate the Zhang-zhung into the Tibetan Empire. In 645, Songtsen Gampo overran the kingdom of Zhang-zhung in what is now Western Tibet.[PARAGRAPH:1]Songtsen Gampo died in 650, and was succeeded by his infant grandson Khri-mang-slon. Real power was left in the hands of the minister Mgar-srong-rtsan.[PARAGRAPH:1]Songtsen Gampo has become a cultural hero for Tibetans, based largely on myths that grew up around him during the Middle Ages. For example it is said that his Nepalese princess Bhrikuti and his Chinese princess Wencheng brought Buddhism to Tibet. No historical evidence supports the existence of this Nepalese princess or the faith of Wencheng, although Buddhism would have been known in China at the time. These stories are included in such medieval romances as the Mani-bka'-'bum, and historiographies such as the Rgyal-rabs Gsel-ba'i Me-long.[PARAGRAPH:1]The stories of Thonmi Sambhota, who is supposed to have invented the Tibetan script, and of the original Jowo statue at Lhasa have similar late medieval origins.</English>
