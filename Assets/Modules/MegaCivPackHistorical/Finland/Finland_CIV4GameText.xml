		<English>[TAB]According to archaeological evidence, the area now comprising Finland was first settled 
around 8500 BC during the Stone Age as the ice shield of the last ice age receded. The earliest people 
were probably hunter-gatherers, living primarily off what the tundra and sea could offer. Pottery is 
known from around 5300 BC (see Comb Ceramic Culture). The existence of an extensive exchange system during 
the mesolithic is indicated by the spread of asbestos and soapstone from eastern Finland, and by finds 
of flint from southern Scandinavia and Russia and slate from Lake Onega and northern Scandinavia. It 
has been postulated and held probable that the speakers of the Finno-Ugric language arrived in the area 
during the Stone Age, and were possibly even among the first Mesolithic settlers [1]. The arrival of 
the Battle-Axe Culture (or Cord-Ceramic Culture) in southern coastal Finland around 3200 BC may have 
coincided with the start of agriculture. However, the earliest certain records of agriculture are from 
the late 3rd millennium BC Hunting and fishing continued to be important parts of the subsistence economy, 
especially in the northern and eastern parts of the country.[PARAGRAPH:2]The beginning of Finland's nearly 
700-year association with the Kingdom of Sweden is traditionally connected with the year 1154 and the 
hypothesized introduction of Christianity by Sweden's King Erik. However, archaeological evidence points 
to prior Christian influences in south-western and south-eastern Finland and include both western and 
eastern Christian artefacts. Historically (more documented), the union began upon Birger Jarl's expedition 
to Finland in 1249. Swedish became the dominant language of administration and education; Finnish chiefly 
a language for the peasantry, clergy and local courts in predominantly Finnish-speaking areas.[PARAGRAPH:2]On 
March 29, 1809, after being conquered by the armies of Russian Emperor Alexander I, Finland became an 
autonomous Grand Duchy under the Russian Empire until the end of 1917. During this time, Finnish started 
gaining recognition by both the imperial court and the governing bodies, first probably to sever the 
cultural and emotional ties with Sweden and thereafter, from the 1860s onwards, as a result of a strong 
nationalist movement, known as the Fennoman movement. Milestones included the publication of what would 
become Finland's national epic, the Kalevala, in 1835; and the Finnish language achieving equal legal 
status with Swedish in 1892.[PARAGRAPH:2]During World War II, Finland fought the Soviet Union twice: 
in the Winter War of 1939-1940 and in the Continuation War of 1941-1944 in accordance with Operation 
Barbarossa in which Germany invaded the Soviet Union. This was followed by the Lapland War of 1944-1945, 
when Finland forced the Germans out of northern Finland.[PARAGRAPH:2]Treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 
with the Soviet Union included obligations, restraints, and reparations on Finland vis-à-vis the Soviet 
Union as well as further Finnish territorial concessions (cf. the Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940). Finland 
ceded most of Finnish Karelia, Salla, and Petsamo, which amounted to 10% of land area, 20% of industrial 
capacity and 400,000 evacuees. The reparations to the Soviet Union forced Finland to transform itself 
from a primarily agrarian economy to an industrialised one. Nevertheless, most trade was with other Western 
countries. Even after reparations were fulfilled, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union in 
the framework of bilateral trade. (Russia has assumed a large part of the Soviet national debt which 
is slowly being remunerated in raw materials and electricity).[PARAGRAPH:2]The post-war era was a period 
of rapid economic growth and increasing wealth and stability for Finland. In all, the war-ravaged agrarian 
country was transformed into a technologically advanced market economy with a sophisticated social welfare 
system. When the Soviet Union fell in 1991, the bilateral trade disappeared overnight, and Finland was 
simultaneously hit by a "home-cooked" severe recession. This left a mass unemployment problem, but the 
economy survived and began growing at a high rate after the recession. Finland joined the European Union 
in 1995, where she is an advocate of federalism contrary to the other Nordic countries that are predominantly 
supportive of confederalism.</English>

		<English>[H1]Urho Kekkonen[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Finland[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 
1900 - 1986[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Urho Kaleva Kekkonen was a Finnish politician who served as Prime Minister 
of Finland and later as President of Finland. Kekkonen continued the "active neutrality" policy of President 
Juho Kusti Paasikivi, which came to be known as the Paasikivi-Kekkonen Line. This policy allowed Finland 
to live with both the nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Warsaw Pact. Kekkonen 
was the longest-serving president of Finland.[PARAGRAPH:1]Throughout his time as president, Kekkonen 
did his best to keep political rivals in check. The Centre Party's rival, National Coalition Party was 
kept in opposition despite good performance in elections. On a few occasions, the parliament was dissolved 
as the political composition did not please Kekkonen. Too prominent Centre Party members often found 
themselves sidelined, as Kekkonen negotiated directly with the lower lever. The "Mill Letters" of Kekkonen 
were a continuous stream of directives to high officials, politicians, journalists etc.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 
the 1960s Kekkonen was responsible for a number of foreign-policy initiatives, involving for example 
the Nordic nuclear-free zone, the border agreement with Norway and a Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe in 1969. The purpose of these initiatives was to avoid the enforcement of the military articles 
in the FCMA treaty - in other words, military co-operation between Finland and the Soviet Union - and 
thus to strengthen Finland's attempt to practice a policy of neutrality. Following the invasion of Czechoslovakia 
in 1968 pressure for neutrality increased. Kekkonen informed the Soviets in 1970 that he would not continue 
as president, nor would the FCMA treaty be extended, if the Soviet Union was no longer prepared to recognise 
Finland's neutrality.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kekkonen was re-elected normally in 1968. In 1973, he was re-elected 
by emergency law which saw his presidency extended by four years. The elimination of any significant 
opposition and competition meant de facto political autocracy for Kekkonen. The year 1975 can be regarded 
as marking the zenith of his power, when he dissolved parliament and hosted the Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki with the assistance of a caretaker government. In the 1978 
Presidential election, with Kekkonen's candidacy being supported by the Social Democratic, Centre and 
National Coalition parties, there were no serious rivals left. Kekkonen won 259 out of the 300 electoral 
college votes, with his nearest rival, Raino Westerholm of the Christian Union. receiving 24.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 
1979 Urho Kekkonen was awarded Lenin Peace Prize. In 1981, Kekkonen begun to suffer from an undisclosed 
disease that seemed to affect his brain functions. In the same year, Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto had 
already defied Kekkonen and he still refused to resign. In September, Kekkonen left for sick leave, and 
in October he resigned. There is no public report about his illness.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kekkonen died at Tamminiemi 
in 1986 and was buried with full honors.</English>
