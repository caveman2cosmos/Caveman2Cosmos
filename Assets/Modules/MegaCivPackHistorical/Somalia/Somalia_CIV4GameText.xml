		<English>[TAB]As early as the seventh century, indigenous Cushitic peoples began to mingle with Arab and Persian traders who had settled along the coast. Interaction over the centuries led to the emergence of a Somali culture bound by common traditions, a single language, and the Islamic faith.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sizable ethnic groups in the country include Bantu agricultural workers, several thousand Arabs and some hundreds of Indians and Pakistanis. Apart from the Brava people who speak a language similar to Swahili, nearly all inhabitants speak the Somali language. A population of Italian descent, which dated back to Somalia's colonial era, began to emigrate following independence and by the outbreak of war most Italian Somalis had left the country. The language remained unwritten until October 1973, when the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) proclaimed it the nation's official language and decreed an orthography using Latin letters. Somali is now the language of instruction in schools, which are few. Arabic, English, and Italian also are used extensively.[PARAGRAPH:2]The independence of Somaliland from Britain was proclaimed on June 26, 1960, and on July 1, 1960, unification of the British and ex-Italian Somali protectorates took place. The government formed with Abdullahi Isse, Aden Abdullah Osman Daar was appointed President and Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as Prime Minister. Later, during 1967, Mohammed Ibrahim Egal became Prime Minister in Aden Abdullahi Osman (nicknamed Aden Adde)'s government. Egal was later chosen as President of a self-declared Somaliland. He died in a hospital in Pretoria on May 3, 2002.[PARAGRAPH:2]In late 1969, a military government assumed power following the assassination of Shermarke, who had been chosen, and served as, President from 1967-1969. Mohamed Siad Barre, a General in the armed forces who was an ally of and helped protect Aden Abullahi Osman's government, became the President in 1969 following a coup d'état. The revolutionary army leaders, headed by Barre, established large-scale public works programmes. They also successfully implemented an urban and rural literacy campaign, in which they helped to dramatically increase the literacy rate from a mere 5% to 55% by the mid-1980s. Intermittent civil war has been a fact of life in Somalia since 1977. In 1991, insurgent forces led by Mohammed Farah Aidid, leader of the United Somali Congress (USC), ousted Siad Barre's government. The same year, the northern portion of the country declared its independence as Somaliland; although de facto independent and relatively stable compared to the tumultuous south, it has not been recognized by any foreign government.[PARAGRAPH:2]Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN humanitarian effort (primarily in the south) was able to alleviate famine conditions. The UN withdrew in Operation United Shield by March 3, 1995, having suffered significant casualties, and order has not yet been restored. Yet another secession from Somalia took place in the northeastern region. The self-proclaimed state took the name Puntland after declaring "temporary" independence in 1998, with the intention that it would participate in any Somali reconciliation to form a new central government. A third secession occurred in 1998 with the declaration of the state of Jubaland. The territory of Jubaland is now encompassed by the state of Southwestern Somalia and its status is unclear. A fourth self-proclaimed entity led by the Rahanweyn Resistance Army (RRA), was set up in 1999, along the lines of the heat or desert Puntland. This "temporary" secession was reasserted in 2002, leading to de facto autonomy of Southwestern Somalia. The RRA had originally set up an autonomous administration over the Bay and Bakool regions of south and central Somalia in 1999.</English>

After receiving education at State Schools, he acquired administrative experience in Government offices. He subsequently devoted himself to his own business. In February 1944, he joined the Somali Youth Club (subsequently called Somali Youth League), became a member of the party's steering board and in 1946 was appointed Secretary of the Belet Weyne section of the party.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1951 the Regional Council of Mudug designated him for the Territorial Council on which he served uninterruptedly (up to February 1956) as the representative of the S.Y.L. In 1953 he was appointed Vice-President of the Territorial Council. In 1954 he became the President of the Somali Youth League and remained office until 1956. Re-elected to the same position in May 1958, he occupied this post simultaneously with the post of the President of the Legislative Assembly until July 1, 1960. In 1956, when the Territorial Council was replaced by Legislative Assembly, he was elected member of the National Assembly for Belet Weyne District at the general political elections, and in meantime the Legislative Assembly appointed him its President.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the 1959 general political elections, he was again elected member of the National Assembly, which again appointed him President. He maintained this post when the Legislative Assembly was converted into the Constituent Assembly. In his capacity as President of the Constituent Assembly, on July 1, 1960, he proclaimed the Independence of the Somali Republic and following the unification of the northern and southern territories - former British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland. The National Assembly chose him as Provisional President of the Republic for period of 1 year, and in 1961 re-elected him to the same mandate for 6 years.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aden Abdullah Osman devoted his interest to legal, social and economic studies. Besides Somali, he spoke Italian, English and Arabic. In the 1967 presidential elections he was beaten by Abdirashid Ali Shermarke. His term as president ended on June 10, 1967. According to the Constitution of the Republic, the out-going President enjoyed life-membership of the Somali National Assembly. Osman Daar now acts as an elder statesman in attempts to establish a lasting peace in Somalia.</Spanish>
