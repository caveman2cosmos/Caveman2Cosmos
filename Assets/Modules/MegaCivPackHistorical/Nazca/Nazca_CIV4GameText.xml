		<English>[TAB]The Nasca culture flourished from the first to eighth centuries AD beside the dry southern coast of Peru in the river valleys of the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage and the Ica Valley. Having been heavily influenced by the preceding Paracas culture, which was known for extremely complex textiles, the Nasca produced an array of beautiful crafts and technologies such as ceramics, textiles, and geoglyphs (most commonly known as the Nazca lines). They also built an impressive system of underground aqueducts, known as puquios, that still function today.[PARAGRAPH:2]Early Nasca society was made up of local chiefdoms and regional centers of power centered around Cahuachi, a non-urban ceremonial site of mounds and plazas. Theories resulting from various excavations at Cahuachi suggest that the site was home to rituals and feasting relating to agriculture, water, and fertility. This may have been as a result of environmental deterioration, the eventual collapse of the center may have also been a result of that decline. Cahuachi lies in the lower portion of the Nazca Valley and was initially occupied during the late Paracas phase. It is entirely unique from all other Nasca sites in the region and it is definitely the most important site concerning the study of ancient Nasca culture. It is a site of natural huacas (hills) that were modified by the people into pyramid mounds. Excavations at Cahuachi have given archaeologists key insights into the culture. The material remains found at the site included large amounts of polychrome pottery, evidence of maize, squash, bean and peanuts, as well as some fish, plain and fancy textiles, trace amounts of gold and spondylus shell, and an array of ritual paraphernalia. The remains of pottery found at Cahuachi led archaeologists to believe that the site was specifically non-urban and ceremonial in nature. The ratio of plain, utilitarian pottery to fine, polychrome pottery was 30% to 70%. If it was an urban center, for example, the amount of utilitarian ceramics would have probably been higher. Construction at Cahuachi ceased and it appears as though the site was abandoned at the very end of Nasca 3/early Nasca 4. Although there are many possible reasons for the collapse of Cahuachi, the peak and cessation of ceremonial use of the site is most commonly associated with the the pan-Andean drought. Later (post-Cahuachi) Nasca society was structured in a similar fashion as it had been before, but less of an emphasis was made in constructing large architectural complexes like those at Cahuachi.[PARAGRAPH:2]The geoglyphs of Nazca or "Nazca lines" are a series of geometric shapes, miles of lines, and large drawings of animal figures (some as large as a football field) constructed on the desert floor in the Nazca region. Many theories have surrounded the great geoglyphs in the Nazca desert. While there are some who believe these enormous lines could not have been drawn by man, the truth is that with a large number of people and a large period of time it would have been more than possible to construct the lines. By extending a rope between two posts and removing the red pebbles on the dessert surface along the rope, the lines could be constructed. The contrast of the red desert pebbles and the lighter earth beneath would make the lines visible from a high altitude. Due to the simplistic construction of the geoglyphs, regular amounts of rainfall would have easily eroded the drawings but the dry desert environment has preserved the lines for hundreds of years. The purpose of the lines also remains debatable. Some interpretations suggest they were created for the Gods to look upon them from above, while others suggest they were some sort of calendar with astronomical alignments that would aid in planting and harvesting of crops. Others have postulated that the purpose of the lines was not to be looked at, but to be walked upon as a sort of ceremonial procession. The lines have been studied by experts of several disciplines. Anthropologists, archaeologists, and astronomers have all studied the lines but no evidence has been found to support any of the above explainations. It remains unlikely that we will ever know the true purpose of the geoglyphs.</English>
