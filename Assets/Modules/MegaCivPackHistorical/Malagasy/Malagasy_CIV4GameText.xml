		<English>[TAB]The written history of Madagascar began in the 7th century, when Arabs established trading posts along the northwest coast. European contact began in the 1500s, when Portuguese sea captain Diego Dias sighted the island after his ship became separated from a fleet going to India. In the late 17th century, the French established trading posts along the east coast. From about 1774 to 1824, it was a favorite haunt for pirates, including Americans, one of whom brought Malagasy rice to South Carolina.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the middle ages, the chiefs of the different settlements on the island began to extend their power through trade with Madagascar's Indian Ocean neighbors, notably North Africa, the Middle-east and India. Large chiefdoms began to dominate considerable areas of the island. Among these were the Sakalava chiefdoms of the Menabe, centered in what is now the town of Morondava, and of Boina, centered in what is now the provincial capital of Mahajanga (Majunga). The influence of the Sakalava extended across what is now the provinces of Antsiranana, Mahajanga and Toliara. But with the domination of the Indian Ocean by the British fleet and the end of the Arab slave trade, the Sakalava would lose their power to the emerging Merina threat. For a short time the Betsimisaraka of the east coast also unified, but this unification was short lived.[PARAGRAPH:2]Beginning in the 1790s, Merina rulers succeeded in establishing hegemony over the major part of the island, including the coast. In 1817, the Merina ruler and the British governor of Mauritius concluded a treaty abolishing the slave trade, which had been important in Madagascar's economy. In return, the island received British military and financial assistance. British influence remained strong for several decades, during which the Merina court was converted to Presbyterianism, Congregationalism, and Anglicanism.[PARAGRAPH:2]The British accepted the imposition of a French protectorate over Madagascar in 1885 in return for eventual control over Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania) and as part of an overall definition of spheres of influence in the area. Absolute French control over Madagascar was established by military force in 1895-1896, and the Merina monarchy was abolished. In December 1904, the Russian Baltic Fleet stopped at Diego Suarez for coal and provisions before sailing on to its doomed encounter with the Japanese Fleet in the Battle of Tsushima. Before leaving port the Russian sailors were required to put ashore the animals they had acquired, including monkeys, boa constrictors and one crocodile.[PARAGRAPH:2]During World War II, Malagasy troops fought in France, Morocco, and Syria. Immediately preceding the fall of France, Germany initiated planning to forcibly deport all of Europe's Jews to Madagascar in what was known as the Madagascar Plan. Action on the plan was never begun. After France fell to Germany, the Vichy government administered Madagascar. British troops occupied the strategic island in 1942 to preclude its seizure by the Japanese. The Free French received the island from the United Kingdom in 1943.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1947, with French prestige at low ebb, a nationalist uprising was suppressed after several months of bitter fighting. The French subsequently established reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully toward independence. The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on October 14, 1958, as an autonomous state within the French Community. A period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on June 26, 1960.[PARAGRAPH:2]Madagascar's population is predominantly of mixed Asian and African origin, though those who are visibly Asian in appearance and culture are the minority, found in the highland regions. Recent research suggests that the island was uninhabited until Malay seafarers arrived between about 2,000 to 1,500 years ago. Recent DNA research shows that the Malagasy are approximately of half Malay and half East African stock, although some Arab, Indian and European influence is present along the coast. The Malagasy language shares some 90% of its basic vocabulary with the Maanyan language from the region of the Barito River in southern Borneo.[PARAGRAPH:2]Subsequent migrations from both the Pacific and Africa further consolidated this original mixture, and 36 separate tribal groups emerged. Asian features are most predominant in the central highlands people, the Merina (3 million) and the Betsileo (2 million); the coastal people (called côtiers) are of more clearly African origin.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Malagasy language is of Malayo-Polynesian origin and is generally spoken throughout the island. French is spoken among the educated population of this former French colony. English is becoming more widely spoken and in 2003 the government began a pilot project of introducing the teaching of English into the primary grades of 44 schools, with hopes of taking the project nationwide.[PARAGRAPH:2]Approximately half of the country's population practices traditional religions, which tend to emphasize links between the living and the dead. The Merina in the highlands particularly tend to hold tightly to this practice. They believe that the dead join their ancestors in the ranks of divinity and that ancestors are intensely concerned with the fate of their living descendants. The Merina and Betsileo reburial practice of famadihana, or "turning over the dead" celebrate this spiritual communion. In this ritual, relatives' remains are removed from the family tomb, rewrapped in new silk shrouds, and returned to the tomb following festive ceremonies in their honor.</English>

		<English>[H1]Andrianampoinimerina[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Ambohimanga [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c. 1770 - 1810[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Andrianampoinimerina, more commonly known as Nampoina ('the Deserved One'), was the king of Merina. He succeeded his father Andriamiaramanjaka in 1787 and beginning in the 1790s, he began establishing control over the major part of the Madagascar island. He established civil and penal codes, distributed land, and reglemented commerce. [PARAGRAPH:1]While written accounts describe a state that was already well organised by the end of the 18th Century, a form of centralized political authority existed before that date. Nampoina expanded the Marina kingdom and the increased the slave trade from Madagascar to Mauritius and other lands. The slave trade provided weapons, and an expansion of the army, which also coincided with the development of literacy, provided by the Antaimoro people of Madagascar, who had retained some Arabic script. [PARAGRAPH:1]After succeeding in gathering all Imerina region kingdoms, Nampoina tackled challenges so as to nourish the whole population. Tools were given to peasants, markets were settled, he had dykes built so as to fit out Betsimitatatra ricefields plains. Thousands of peasants worked there. In order to encourage them and convey royal guidelines, Nampoina sent his best Mpikabary (orators), singers and dancers on building sites, roadworks and ricefields. [PARAGRAPH:1]All along the 19th century, the sovereigns of Imerina (the central Highlands of Madagascar) made it their business to extend their authority to the rest of the country. Various chiefs of clans, and later the princes of various regions, had fought to expand their territories, but the first deliberate effort to unify the country was undertaken by Nampoina. Probably due to the exceptional stature he had built for himself, his legacy acquired a sacredness that was used by all his successors to legitimise their authority. One outstanding part of that legacy was that he prescribed that royalty should be kept in the hands of his female relatives and their female descendants. Except for the transition he had accorded to his son Radama, women henceforth ruled in Madagascar: Ranavalona I (1828-1861), Rasoherina (1863-1868), Ranavalona II (1868-1883) and Ranavalona III (1883-1896).

He succeeded his father Andriamiaramanjaka in 1787 and beginning in the 1790s, he began establishing control over the major part of the Madagascar island. He established civil and penal codes, distributed land, and reglemented commerce. [PARAGRAPH:1]While written accounts describe a state that was already well organised by the end of the 18th Century, a form of centralized political authority existed before that date. Nampoina expanded the Marina kingdom and the increased the slave trade from Madagascar to Mauritius and other lands. The slave trade provided weapons, and an expansion of the army, which also coincided with the development of literacy, provided by the Antaimoro people of Madagascar, who had retained some Arabic script. [PARAGRAPH:1]After succeeding in gathering all Imerina region kingdoms, Nampoina tackled challenges so as to nourish the whole population. Tools were given to peasants, markets were settled, he had dykes built so as to fit out Betsimitatatra ricefields plains. Thousands of peasants worked there. In order to encourage them and convey royal guidelines, Nampoina sent his best Mpikabary (orators), singers and dancers on building sites, roadworks and ricefields. [PARAGRAPH:1]All along the 19th century, the sovereigns of Imerina (the central Highlands of Madagascar) made it their business to extend their authority to the rest of the country. Various chiefs of clans, and later the princes of various regions, had fought to expand their territories, but the first deliberate effort to unify the country was undertaken by Nampoina. Probably due to the exceptional stature he had built for himself, his legacy acquired a sacredness that was used by all his successors to legitimise their authority. One outstanding part of that legacy was that he prescribed that royalty should be kept in the hands of his female relatives and their female descendants. Except for the transition he had accorded to his son Radama, women henceforth ruled in Madagascar: Ranavalona I (1828-1861), Rasoherina (1863-1868), Ranavalona II (1868-1883) and Ranavalona III (1883-1896).
