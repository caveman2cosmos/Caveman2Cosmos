		<English>[TAB]Long before the days of Rome's greatness, Italy was the home of a people far advanced 
in civilization - the Etruscans, or Tyrrhenians. These people rose to prosperity and power, then almost 
vanished from recorded history, leaving unsolved many questions about their origin and culture.[PARAGRAPH:2]Scholars 
think that the Etruscans were a seafaring people from Asia Minor. As early as 1000 BC they were living 
in Italy in an area that was roughly equivalent to modern Tuscany, from the Tiber River north almost 
to the Arno River. Later their rule embraced a large part of western Italy, including Rome. When the 
Tarquin Dynasty was expelled from Rome about 500 BC, Lars Porsena, king of Etruria and Clusium, sought 
to reestablish his influence over Rome.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Etruscans already controlled the commerce of 
the Tyrrhenian Sea on their western border. After losing control of Rome, they strengthened their naval 
power through an alliance with Carthage against Greece. In 474 BCtheir fleet was destroyed by the Greeks 
of Syracuse. From that time their power rapidly declined. The Gauls overran the country from the north, 
and the Etruscans' strong southern fortress of Veii fell to Rome after a ten-year seige (396 BC). The 
Etruscans were absorbed by the Romans, who adopted many of their advanced arts, their customs, and their 
institutions.[PARAGRAPH:2]Because little Etruscan literature remains and the language of inscriptions 
on their monuments has been only partially deciphered, scholars have gained most of their knowledge of 
the Etruscans from studying the remains of their city walls, houses, monuments, and tombs. Weapons and 
other implements, exquisite jewelry, coins, statues of stone, bronze, and terra-cotta, and black pottery 
(called bucchero) have been found. Grecian and Oriental influences are seen in this art.</English>

c.500 BC [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background: [\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Lars Porsena (sometimes spelled 
Lars Porsenna) was an Etruscan king known for his war against the city of Rome. He ruled over the city 
of Clusium, sometimes referred to as Clevsin. There are no established dates for his rule, but Roman 
sources often place it at around 500 BC.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lars Porsena came into conflict with Rome after 
the revolution which overthrew, in 510 BC, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last King of Rome. The deposed 
monarch, whose family was of Etruscan origin, appealed to Lars Porsena for assistance in suppressing 
the new Roman Republic, and Lars Porsena agreed to help.[PARAGRAPH:1]At this point, however, there is 
divergence in the histories. According to most mainstream Roman accounts, including those of Livy, Lars 
Porsena arrived at Rome, but was sufficiently impressed by Roman bravery (see Mucius, Horatius) in defending 
the city that he chose to make peace. Other accounts, however, suggest that Lars Porsena actually succeeded 
in capturing the city, and that the Etruscans were only driven out some time afterwards. None of the 
accounts suggest that Lucius Tarquinius Superbus was returned to the throne, however, perhaps indicating 
that if Lars Porsena did indeed capture Rome, he did so with the intent of controlling it himself, not 
restoring the former dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to most accounts, Lars Porsena was buried in an elaborate 
tomb in (or under) the city he ruled. Porsena's tomb is described as having a 15 m high rectangular base 
with sides 90 m long. It was adorned by pyramids and massive bells.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lars Porsena's tomb, 
together with the rest of the city of Clusium, was razed to the ground in 89 BC by the Roman general 
Cornelius Sulla.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>
