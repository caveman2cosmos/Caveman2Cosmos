		<English>[TAB]The modern state of Pakistan was established in 1947, but the region has an extensive 
ancient history that overlaps with the histories of Ancient India, Iran and Afghanistan. The region was 
a crossroads of historic trade routes, including the Silk Road, and was settled over thousands of years 
by many groups including Dravidians, Indo-Aryans, Persians, Greeks, Scythians, Kushans, White Huns, Afghans, 
Turks and Arabs. Historian and geographer de Blij Muller characterized quite aptly while describing the 
historical embodiment of the land when he said,"If, as is so often said, Egypt is the gift of the Nile, 
then Pakistan is the gift of the Indus." The earliest evidence of humans is pebble tools of the Soan 
Culture in the Punjab province between 500,000 to 100,000 years ago. The Indus region was the site of 
several ancient cultures including Mehrgarh, one of the world's earliest towns, and the Indus Valley 
Civilisation at Harrappa and Mohenjo-Daro. The Indus Valley Civilisation collapsed in the middle of the 
second millennium BCE and was followed by the Vedic Civilisation which extended over much of northern 
India and Pakistan. Successive empires and kingdoms ruled the region from the Achaemenid Persian empire 
around 543 BCE, to Alexander the Great in 326 BCE and the Mauryan empire. The Indo-Greek Kingdom founded 
by Demetrius of Bactria included Gandhara and Punjab from 184 BCE, and reached its greatest extent under 
Menander, establishing the Greco-Buddhist period with advances in trade and culture. The city of Taxila 
(Takshashila) became a major centre of learning prior to the arrival of Islam - the ruins may still be 
seen within the Swat Valley, to the west of Islamabad.[PARAGRAPH:2]In AD 712, the Arab general Muhammad 
bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Multan in southern Punjab, setting the stage for several successive Muslim 
empires including the Ghaznavid Empire, the Ghorid Kingdom, the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. 
During this period Sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional population 
to Islam. The gradual decline of the Mughal Empire in the early eighteenth century provided opportunities 
for the Afghans, Balochis and Sikhs to exercise control over large areas until the British East India 
Company gained ascendancy over South Asia.[PARAGRAPH:2]17th Century Badshahi Masjid built by Mughal emperor 
Aurangzeb in LahoreThe 1857 War of Independence was the region's last major armed struggle against the 
British, but it laid the foundations for the generally unarmed freedom struggle led by the Congress. 
However the Muslim League rose to popularity in the late 1930's amid fears of under-representation and 
neglect of Muslims in politics. In 1930 Allama Iqbal called for a separate Muslim state in northwest 
and eastern South Asia. Muhammad Ali Jinnah espoused the Two Nation Theory and led the Muslim League 
to adopt the Lahore Resolution of 1940, which led to independence in 1947. [PARAGRAPH:2]Pakistan was 
formed on August 14, 1947 with two Muslim-majority wings in the eastern and northwestern regions of the 
South Asia, separated by Hindu-majority India, and comprising the provinces of Balochistan, East Bengal, 
the North-West Frontier Province, West Punjab and Sindh. The partition of British India resulted in communal 
riots across India and Pakistan-millions of Muslims moved to Pakistan and millions of Hindus and Sikhs 
moved to India. Disputes arose over several princely states including Jammu and Kashmir which led to 
the First Kashmir War (1948) ending with Pakistan and India each occupying large parts of the state. 
From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a Dominion in the Commonwealth of Nations. The republic declared in 1958 
was stalled by a coup d'etat by Ayub Khan (1958-69), who was president during a period of internal instability 
and a second war with India in 1965. His successor, Yahya Khan (1969-71) had to deal with the cyclone 
which caused 500,000 deaths in East Pakistan.[PARAGRAPH:2]Economic and political dissent in East Pakistan 
led to violent political repression and tensions escalating into civil war (Bangladesh Liberation War) 
and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and ultimately the secession of East Pakistan as the independent state 
of Bangladesh. Civilian rule resumed from 1972 to 1977 under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, but he was deposed 
(and hanged to death in 1979 by court orders) by General Zia-ul-Haq, who became the third military president. 
The secular policies of the past were replaced by Zia's introduction of the Islamic Shariat legal code, 
and increased religious influences on the civil service and the military. Muhammad Khan Junejo was elected 
in 1985 as Prime Minister, but with the death of General Zia in a plane crash in 1988, Benazir Bhutto, 
daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan. Over the 
next decade, she alternated in power with Nawaz Sharif as the political and economic situation worsened.[PARAGRAPH:2]Military 
tensions in the Kargil conflict with India in 1999 were followed by a military coup in which General 
Pervez Musharraf assumed executive powers. In 2001, he became President after the resignation of Rafiq

Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali, who was succeeded in 2004 by Shaukat Aziz. On 8 October 2005, a powerful

- 2007 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Benazir Bhutto was the first woman 
to lead a post-colonial Muslim state. She was elected Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1988, only to be 
deposed 20 months later by the country's military supported president Ghulam Ishaq Khan who used the 
Eighth Amendment to dissolve parliament and force an election. She was re-elected in 1993 but was dismissed 
three years later amid various corruption scandals by the then president Farooq Leghari, who also used 
the Eighth Amendment discretionary powers. Some of these scandals involved contracts awarded to Swiss 
companies during her regime about which she faces charges in Switzerland which remain unresolved. Her 
husband, Asif Ali Zardari, spent eight years in jail until he was released November 2004.[PARAGRAPH:1]After 
completing university, she returned to Pakistan, but in the course of her father's imprisonment and execution, 
she was placed under house arrest. Having been allowed in 1984 to go back to the UK, she became leader 
in exile of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), her father's party, but was unable to make her political
