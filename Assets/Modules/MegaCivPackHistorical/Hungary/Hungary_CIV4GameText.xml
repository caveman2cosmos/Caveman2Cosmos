		<English>[TAB]In the time of the Roman Empire, the Romans called the region Pannonia (west from the 
Danube river). After Rome fell the Migration Period brought on many invaders. First came the Huns, who 
built up a powerful empire under Attila. The name "Hungary" may be influenced by the name of the Hun 
people, although it probably comes from the name of a later, 7th century state called Onogur (or possibly 
from the name of the city Ungvar, which was possibly the first major city the magyars occupied). After 
the Hunnish rule faded, Germanic tribes Lombards and Gepids ruled in Pannonia for about 100 years, during 
which the Slavic tribes also began migrating south. In the 560s, these were supplanted by the Avars who 
would maintain their supremacy of the land for over two centuries. The Franks under Charlemagne from 
the west and the Bulgars from the southeast finally managed to overthrow the Avars in the early 9th century. 
Soon after, the Franks retreated, and the Slavonic kingdom of Great Moravia and the Balaton Principality 
controlled much of Pannonia until the end of the century. Finally, the Magyars migrated to Hungary in 
the late 9th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]Tradition holds that the Country of the Magyars (Hungary) was founded 
by Arpad, who led the Magyars into the Pannonian plains after 895. The Kingdom of Hungary was established 
in 1000 by King St. Stephen I. Initially the history of Hungary was developed in a triangle with that 
of Poland and Bohemia, with the many liaisons with Popes and Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. Hungary 
was partially demolished with a great loss of life in 1241-1242 by Mongol (Tartar) armies of Batu Khan.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gradually 
Hungary under the rule of the dynasty of the Arpads turned into an independent kingdom which formed a 
distinct Central European culture with ties to greater West European civilisation. Ruled by the Angevins 
since 1308, the Kingdom of Hungary briefly extended its control over Wallachia and Moldavia. The non-dynastic 
king Matthias Corvinus, son of John Hunyadi, ruled the Kingdom of Hungary from 1458 to 1490. He strengthened 
Hungary and its government. Under his rule, Hungary (notably the northern parts, some of which are in 
Slovakia today) became an important artistic and cultural centre of Europe during the Renaissance. Hungarian 
culture influenced others, for example the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Together with Polish and Czech 
lands, Hungary formed the Visegrad group of countries. Today an alliance of the same name exists again 
with the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hungarian independence ended with the Ottoman 
conquest at the beginning of the 16th century; the parts of Hungary that were not conquered by the Ottomans 
were annexed by Austria (the rulers of which were Hungarian kings at the same time) in the West, and 
became the independent Principality of Transylvania in the East, where thus Hungarian statedom was preserved. 
After 150 years, Austria and her Christian allies retook also the territory of today's Hungary by the 
end of the 17th century from the Islamic Ottoman Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the final retreat of the Turks, 
struggle began between the Hungarian nation and the Habsburg kings for the protection of noblemen's rights 
(thus guarding the autonomy of Hungary). The fight against Austrian absolutism resulted in the unsuccessful 
popular freedom fight led by a Transylvanian nobleman, Ferenc II Rakoczi, between 1704 and 1711. The 
revolution and war of 1848-1849 eliminated serfdom and secured civil rights. The Austrians were finally 
able to prevail only with Russian help.[PARAGRAPH:2]Thanks to the victories against Austria by the French-Italian 
coalition (the Battle of Solferino, 1859) and Prussia (Battle of Koniggratz, 1866), Hungary would eventually, 
in 1867, manage to become an autonomous part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Having achieved this, the 
Hungarian government took an effort to nationally unify the kingdom by Magyarisation of the various other 
nationalities. This lasted until the end of World War I, when the Austro-Hungarian empire collapsed. 
On November 16, 1918, an independent Hungarian Republic was proclaimed.[PARAGRAPH:2]In March 1919 the 
communists took power, and in April, Bela Kun proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic. This government, 
like its predecessor, proved to be short lived; after some initial military successes against the Czechoslovak 
army, the Romanians attacked to prevent a campaign in Transylvania. By August more than half of present-day 
Hungary, including Budapest, was placed under Romanian occupation, which lasted until November. Rightist 
military forces, led by the former Austro-Hungarian Admiral Miklos Horthy, entered Budapest in the wake 
of the Romanian army's departure and filled the vacuum of state power. In January 1920, elections were 
held for a unicameral assembly, and Admiral Horthy was subsequently elected Regent, thereby formally 
restoring Hungary to a kingdom, although there were no more Kings of Hungary, despite attempts by the 
former Habsburg king to return to power. Horthy continued to rule with autocratic powers until 1944.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 
June 1920, the Treaty of Trianon was signed, fixing Hungary's borders. Compared with the pre-war Kingdom, 
the size and population of this new Hungary were reduced by about two-thirds; about one-third of the 
Magyar population became minorities in the neighbouring countries. Therefore, Hungarian politics and 
culture of the interwar period were saturated with irredentism and revisionism (the restoration of 19th 
century "greater Hungary" by whatever means necessary).[PARAGRAPH:2]Horthy made an alliance with Nazi 
Germany in the 1930s, in the hope of revising the territorial losses that had followed World War I. The 
alliance did lead to some territories being given to Hungary in the two Vienna Awards. Hungary then assisted 
the German occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, occupying the Banat right afterwards, and finally 
entered World War II in 1941, fighting primarily against the Soviet Union. In October 1944, Hitler replaced 
Horthy with the Hungarian Nazi collaborator Ferenc Szalasi and his Arrow Cross Party in order to avert 
Hungary's defection to the Allied side, which were constantly threatened since the Allied invasion of 
Italy.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hungary passed a series of anti-Semitic laws throughot the 1920s and thirties, and 
some massacres of Jews by Hungarian forces took place in the early part of the Second World War, but 
Hungary initially resisted large scale deportation of its Jewish population. Ultimately, however, during 
the German occupation, the Arrow Cross Party and government authorities participated fully in the Holocaust: 
in May and June of 1944, Hungarian police deported nearly 440,000 Jews in more than 145 trains, mostly 
to Auschwitz [1]. Ultimately, over 533,000 Jews in Hungary were killed during the Holocaust, as well 
as several tens of thousands of Roma.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following the fall of Nazi Germany, Hungary became 
part of the Soviet area of influence and was appropriated into a communist state following a short period 
of democracy in 1946-1947. After 1948 Communist leader Matyas Rakosi established a Stalinist rule in 
the country, which was barely bearable for the war-torn country. This led to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution 
and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact which were met with a massive military intervention 
by the Soviet Union. From the 1960s on to the late 1980s Hungary enjoyed a distinguished status of "the 
happiest barrack" within the Eastern bloc, under the rule of late controversial communist leader Janos 
Kadar, who exercised autocratic rule during this period. In the late 1980s, Hungary led the movement 
to dissolve the Warsaw Pact and shifted toward multiparty democracy and a market-oriented economy. Following 
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Hungary developed closer ties with Western Europe, joined NATO 
in 1999 and the European Union on May 1, 2004.</English>

part of the Soviet area of influence and was appropriated into a communist state following a short period 
of democracy in 1946-1947. After 1948 Communist leader Matyas Rakosi established a Stalinist rule in 
the country, which was barely bearable for the war-torn country. This led to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution 
and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact which were met with a massive military intervention 
by the Soviet Union. From the 1960s on to the late 1980s Hungary enjoyed a distinguished status of "the 
happiest barrack" within the Eastern bloc, under the rule of late controversial communist leader Janos 
Kadar, who exercised autocratic rule during this period. In the late 1980s, Hungary led the movement 
to dissolve the Warsaw Pact and shifted toward multiparty democracy and a market-oriented economy. Following 
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Hungary developed closer ties with Western Europe, joined NATO

		<Spanish>[TAB]In the time of the Roman Empire, the Romans called the region Pannonia (west from the 
Danube river). After Rome fell the Migration Period brought on many invaders. First came the Huns, who 
built up a powerful empire under Attila. The name "Hungary" may be influenced by the name of the Hun 
people, although it probably comes from the name of a later, 7th century state called Onogur (or possibly 
from the name of the city Ungvar, which was possibly the first major city the magyars occupied). After 
the Hunnish rule faded, Germanic tribes Lombards and Gepids ruled in Pannonia for about 100 years, during 
which the Slavic tribes also began migrating south. In the 560s, these were supplanted by the Avars who 
would maintain their supremacy of the land for over two centuries. The Franks under Charlemagne from 
the west and the Bulgars from the southeast finally managed to overthrow the Avars in the early 9th century. 
Soon after, the Franks retreated, and the Slavonic kingdom of Great Moravia and the Balaton Principality 
controlled much of Pannonia until the end of the century. Finally, the Magyars migrated to Hungary in 
the late 9th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]Tradition holds that the Country of the Magyars (Hungary) was founded 
by Arpad, who led the Magyars into the Pannonian plains after 895. The Kingdom of Hungary was established 
in 1000 by King St. Stephen I. Initially the history of Hungary was developed in a triangle with that 
of Poland and Bohemia, with the many liaisons with Popes and Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. Hungary 
was partially demolished with a great loss of life in 1241-1242 by Mongol (Tartar) armies of Batu Khan.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gradually 
Hungary under the rule of the dynasty of the Arpads turned into an independent kingdom which formed a 
distinct Central European culture with ties to greater West European civilisation. Ruled by the Angevins 
since 1308, the Kingdom of Hungary briefly extended its control over Wallachia and Moldavia. The non-dynastic 
king Matthias Corvinus, son of John Hunyadi, ruled the Kingdom of Hungary from 1458 to 1490. He strengthened 
Hungary and its government. Under his rule, Hungary (notably the northern parts, some of which are in 
Slovakia today) became an important artistic and cultural centre of Europe during the Renaissance. Hungarian 
culture influenced others, for example the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Together with Polish and Czech 
lands, Hungary formed the Visegrad group of countries. Today an alliance of the same name exists again 
with the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hungarian independence ended with the Ottoman 
conquest at the beginning of the 16th century; the parts of Hungary that were not conquered by the Ottomans 
were annexed by Austria (the rulers of which were Hungarian kings at the same time) in the West, and 
became the independent Principality of Transylvania in the East, where thus Hungarian statedom was preserved. 
After 150 years, Austria and her Christian allies retook also the territory of today's Hungary by the 
end of the 17th century from the Islamic Ottoman Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the final retreat of the Turks, 
struggle began between the Hungarian nation and the Habsburg kings for the protection of noblemen's rights 
(thus guarding the autonomy of Hungary). The fight against Austrian absolutism resulted in the unsuccessful 
popular freedom fight led by a Transylvanian nobleman, Ferenc II Rakoczi, between 1704 and 1711. The 
revolution and war of 1848-1849 eliminated serfdom and secured civil rights. The Austrians were finally 
able to prevail only with Russian help.[PARAGRAPH:2]Thanks to the victories against Austria by the French-Italian 
coalition (the Battle of Solferino, 1859) and Prussia (Battle of Koniggratz, 1866), Hungary would eventually, 
in 1867, manage to become an autonomous part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Having achieved this, the 
Hungarian government took an effort to nationally unify the kingdom by Magyarisation of the various other 
nationalities. This lasted until the end of World War I, when the Austro-Hungarian empire collapsed. 
On November 16, 1918, an independent Hungarian Republic was proclaimed.[PARAGRAPH:2]In March 1919 the 
communists took power, and in April, Bela Kun proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic. This government, 
like its predecessor, proved to be short lived; after some initial military successes against the Czechoslovak 
army, the Romanians attacked to prevent a campaign in Transylvania. By August more than half of present-day 
Hungary, including Budapest, was placed under Romanian occupation, which lasted until November. Rightist 
military forces, led by the former Austro-Hungarian Admiral Miklos Horthy, entered Budapest in the wake 
of the Romanian army's departure and filled the vacuum of state power. In January 1920, elections were 
held for a unicameral assembly, and Admiral Horthy was subsequently elected Regent, thereby formally 
restoring Hungary to a kingdom, although there were no more Kings of Hungary, despite attempts by the 
former Habsburg king to return to power. Horthy continued to rule with autocratic powers until 1944.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 
June 1920, the Treaty of Trianon was signed, fixing Hungary's borders. Compared with the pre-war Kingdom, 
the size and population of this new Hungary were reduced by about two-thirds; about one-third of the 
Magyar population became minorities in the neighbouring countries. Therefore, Hungarian politics and 
culture of the interwar period were saturated with irredentism and revisionism (the restoration of 19th 
century "greater Hungary" by whatever means necessary).[PARAGRAPH:2]Horthy made an alliance with Nazi 
Germany in the 1930s, in the hope of revising the territorial losses that had followed World War I. The 
alliance did lead to some territories being given to Hungary in the two Vienna Awards. Hungary then assisted 
the German occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, occupying the Banat right afterwards, and finally 
entered World War II in 1941, fighting primarily against the Soviet Union. In October 1944, Hitler replaced 
Horthy with the Hungarian Nazi collaborator Ferenc Szalasi and his Arrow Cross Party in order to avert 
Hungary's defection to the Allied side, which were constantly threatened since the Allied invasion of 
Italy.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hungary passed a series of anti-Semitic laws throughot the 1920s and thirties, and 
some massacres of Jews by Hungarian forces took place in the early part of the Second World War, but 
Hungary initially resisted large scale deportation of its Jewish population. Ultimately, however, during 
the German occupation, the Arrow Cross Party and government authorities participated fully in the Holocaust: 
in May and June of 1944, Hungarian police deported nearly 440,000 Jews in more than 145 trains, mostly 
to Auschwitz [1]. Ultimately, over 533,000 Jews in Hungary were killed during the Holocaust, as well 
as several tens of thousands of Roma.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following the fall of Nazi Germany, Hungary became 
part of the Soviet area of influence and was appropriated into a communist state following a short period 
of democracy in 1946-1947. After 1948 Communist leader Matyas Rakosi established a Stalinist rule in

		<English>[H1]Lajos Kossuth[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Regent of Hungary[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Kossuth was born at 
Monok, a small town in the county of Zemplen, the eldest of four children. His father belonged to minor 
nobility, had a small estate, and was an advocate by profession. His mother raised the family as strict 
Lutherans. Kossuth completed his education at the Calvinist college of S&#225;rospatak and the University 
of Pest-Buda (now Budapest). Aged nineteen, he entered his father's legal practice. He was popular locally, 
and, having been appointed steward to the countess Szapary, a widow with large estates, he became her 
voting representative in the county assembly and settled in Pest. He was subsequently dismissed on the 
grounds of using estate funds to pay a gambling debt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Shortly after his dismissal by Countess 
Szapary, Kossuth was appointed as deputy to Count Hunyady at the National Diet. The Diet met during 18251827 
and 18321836 in Pressburg, then capital of Hungary. Only the upper aristocracy could vote, however, 
and Kossuth took little part in the debates. At the time, a struggle to reassert a Hungarian national 
identity was beginning to emerge under able leaders  most notably Wessel&#233;nyi and the Sz&#233;chenyis. 
In part, this was also a struggle for reform against the stagnant Austrian government. Kossuth's duties 
to Count Hunyady included reporting on Diet proceedings in writing, as the Austrian government, fearing 
popular dissent, had banned published reports. The high quality of Kossuth's letters led to their being 
circulated in manuscript among other Liberal magnates. Readership demands turned his output into the 
editing of an organized parliamentary gazette; spreading his name and influence further. Orders from 
the Official Censor halted circulation by lithograph printing. Distribution in manuscript by post was 
forbidden by the government, although circulation by hand continued.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1836 the Diet was 
dissolved. Kossuth continued to report (in letter form), covering the debates of the county assemblies. 
This new-found publicity gave the assemblies national political prominence. Previously they had had little 
idea of each others' proceedings. His skilful embellishment of the speeches from the Liberals and Reformers 
further enhanced the impact of his newsletters. The government in vain attempted to suppress the letters, 
and other means having failed, he was in May 1837, with Wessel&#233;nyi and several others, arrested 
on a charge of high treason. After spending a year in prison at Buda awaiting trial, he was condemned 
to four more years' imprisonment. His strict confinement damaged his health, but he was allowed to read. 
He greatly increased his political knowledge, and also acquired, from the study of the Bible and Shakespeare, 
a thorough knowledge of English.[PARAGRAPH:2]The arrests had caused great indignation. The Diet, which 
reconvened in 1839, demanded the release of the prisoners, and refused to pass any government measures. 
Metternich long remained obdurate, but the danger of war in 1840 obliged him to give way. Wessel&#233;nyi 
had been broken by his imprisonment, but Kossuth, partly supported by the frequent visits of Teresa Meszleny, 
emerged from prison unbroken. Immediately after his release Kossuth and Meszleny were married, and she 
remained a firm supporter of his politics. The Roman Catholic priests refused to bless the marriage as 
Kossuth would not convert to Meszleny's religion. Resultingly, Kossuth became a firm defender of mixed 
marriages.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kossuth had now become a national icon. He regained full health in January 1841 
and was appointed editor of Pesti H&#237;rlap, a new Liberal party newspaper. Notably, the government 
agreed to grant a licence. The paper achieved unprecedented success; soon reaching the then immense circulation 
of 7000 copies. A competing pro-government paper, Vil&#225;g, started up but it only served to increase 
Kossuth's visibility and add to the general political fervour.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sz&#233;chenyi, the great 
reformer, publicly warned Kossuth that his appeals to the passions of the people would lead the nation 
to revolution. Kossuth, undaunted, did not stop at the publicly reasoned reforms demanded by all Liberals: 
the abolition of entail, the abolition of feudal burdens and taxation of the nobles. He went on to broach 
the possibility of separating from Austria. By combining this nationalism with an insistence on the superiority 
of the Magyars to the Slavonic inhabitants of Hungary, he sowed the seeds of both the collapse of Hungary 
in 1849 and his own political demise.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1844, Kossuth was dismissed from Pesti H&#237;rlap 
after a dispute with the proprietor over salary. It is believed that the dispute was rooted in government 
intrigue. Kossuth was unable to obtain permission to start his own newspaper. In a personal interview 
Metternich offered to take him into the government service. Kossuth refused, and spent the next three 
years without a regular position. He continued to agitate on behalf of both political and commercial 
independence for Hungary. He adopted the economic principles of List, and was the founder of a "V&#233;degylet" 
society  whose members consumed only Hungarian produce. He also argued for the creation of a Hungarian 
port at Fiume.[PARAGRAPH:2]In autumn 1847, Kossuth was able to take his final key step. Due to the support 
of Lajos Batthy&#225;ny during a keenly fought campaign, he was elected to the new Diet as member for 
Pest. He proclaimed: "Now that I am a deputy, I will cease to be an agitator." He immediately became 
chief leader of the Extreme Liberals. Ferenc De&#225;k was absent. Batthy&#225;ny, Istv&#225;n Sz&#233;chenyi, 
Szemere and J&#243;zsef E&#246;tv&#246;s, his political rivals, felt that his personal ambition and egoism 
led him to assume the chief place, and to use his parliamentary position to establish himself as leader 
of the nation; but before his eloquence and energy all apprehensions were useless. His eloquence was 
of that nature, in its impassioned appeals to the strongest emotions, that it required for its full effect 
the highest themes and the most dramatic situations. In a time of rest, though he could never have been 
obscure, he would never have attained the highest power. It was therefore a necessity of his nature, 
perhaps unconsciously, always to drive things to a crisis.[PARAGRAPH:2]The crisis came, and he used it 
to the full. On March 3, 1848, shortly after the news of the revolution in Paris had arrived, in a speech 
of surpassing power he demanded parliamentary government for Hungary and constitutional government for 
the rest of Austria. He appealed to the hope of the Habsburgs, "our beloved Archduke Franz Joseph" (then 
17 years old), to perpetuate the ancient glory of the dynasty by meeting half-way the aspirations of 
a free people. He at once became the leader of the European revolution; his speech was read aloud in 
the streets of Vienna to the mob by which Metternich was overthrown (March 13), and when a deputation 
from the Diet visited Vienna to receive the assent of Emperor Ferdinand to their petition it was Kossuth 
who received the chief ovation. Batthy&#225;ny, who formed the first responsible government, appointed 
Kossuth the Minister of Finance.[PARAGRAPH:2]With amazing energy he began developing the internal resources 
of the country: re-establishing a separate Hungarian coinage, and using every means to increase national 
self-consciousness Characteristically, the new Hungarian bank notes had Kossuth's name as the most prominent 
inscription; making reference to "Kossuth Notes" a future byword. A new paper was started, to which was 
given the name of Kossuth H&#237;rlapja, so that from the first it was Kossuth rather than the Palatine 
or the president of the ministry whose name was in the minds of the people associated with the new government. 
Much more was this the case when, in the summer, the dangers from the Croats, Serbs and the reaction 
at Vienna increased. In a great speech July 11 he asked that the nation should arm in self-defence, and 
demanded 200,000 men; amid a scene of wild enthusiasm this was granted by acclamation. When Jellachich 
was marching on Pest he went from town to town rousing the people to the defence of the country, and 
the popular force of the Honv&#233;d was his creation. When Batthy&#225;ny resigned he was appointed 
with Szemere to carry on the government provisionally, and at the end of September he was made President 
of the Committee of National Defence.[PARAGRAPH:2]From this time he was a virtual dictator. The direction 
of the whole government was in his hands. Without military experience, he had to control and direct the 
movements of armies; he was unable to keep control over the generals or to establish that military co-operation 
so essential to success. Art&#250;r G&#246;rgey in particular, whose great abilities Kossuth was the 
first to recognize, refused obedience; the two men were very different personalities. Twice Kossuth deposed 
him from the command; twice he had to restore him. It would have been well if Kossuth had had something 
more of G&#246;rgey's calculated ruthlessness, for, as has been truly said, the revolutionary power he 
had seized could only be held by revolutionary means; but he was by nature soft-hearted and always merciful; 
though often audacious, he lacked decision in dealing with men. It has been said that he showed a want 
of personal courage; this is not improbable, the excess of feeling which made him so great an orator 
could hardly be combined with the coolness in danger required of a soldier; but no one was able, as he 
was, to infuse courage into others.[PARAGRAPH:2]During all the terrible winter which followed, his energy 
and spirit never failed him. It was he who overcame the reluctance of the army to march to the relief 
of Vienna; after the defeat of Schwechat, at which he was present, he sent Bern to carry on the war in 
Transylvania. At the end of the year, when the Austrians were approaching Pest, he asked for the mediation 
of Mr Stiles, the American envoy. Windisch-Gr&#228;tz, however, refused all terms, and the Diet and government 
fled to Debrecen, Kossuth taking with him the Crown of St Stephen, the sacred emblem of the Hungarian 
nation. In November 1848, Emperor Ferdinand abdicated in favour of Franz Joseph. The new Emperor revoked 
all the concessions granted in March and outlawed Kossuth and his colleagues. In April 1849, when the 
Hungarians had won many successes, after sounding the army, he issued the celebrated declaration of Hungarian 
independence, in which he declared that "the house of Habsburg-Lorraine, perjured in the sight of God 
and man, had forfeited the Hungarian throne." It was a step characteristic of his love for extreme and 
dramatic action, but it added to the dissensions between him and those who wished only for autonomy under 
the old dynasty, and his enemies did not scruple to accuse him of aiming for Kingship. For the time the 
future form of government was left undecided, but Kossuth was appointed Regent. The hopes of ultimate 
success were frustrated by the intervention of Russia; all appeals to the western powers were vain, and 
on August 11 Kossuth abdicated in favor of G&#246;rgey, on the ground that in the last extremity the 
general alone could save the nation. G&#246;rgey capitulated at Vil&#225;gos to the Russians, who handed 
over the army to the Austrians. G&#246;rgey was spared  at the insistence of the Russians. Reprisals 
were taken on the rest of the Hungarian army. Kossuth steadfastly maintained until his death that G&#246;rgey 
alone was responsible for the humiliation.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kossuth's career was at an end. A solitary fugitive, 
he crossed the Turkish frontier. He was hospitably received by the Turkish authorities, who, supported 
by the British, refused, notwithstanding the threats of the allied emperors, to surrender him and other 
fugitives to Austria. In January 1849 he was removed from Vidin, where he had been kept under house arrest, 
to Shumla, and thence to Katahia in Asia Minor. Here he was joined by his children, who had been confined 
at Pozsony/Pressburg (Bratislava); his wife (a price had been set on her head) had joined him earlier, 
having escaped in disguise.[PARAGRAPH:2]In September 1851 he was allowed to leave Turkey on an American 
man-of-war. He first landed at Marseille, where he received an enthusiastic welcome from the people, 
but the Prince-President Louis Napoleon refused to allow him to cross France. On October 23 he landed 
at Southampton and spent three weeks in England, where he was generally feted. Addresses were presented 
to him at Southampton, Birmingham and other towns; he was officially entertained by the Lord Mayor of 
London; at each place he spoke eloquently in English for the Hungarian cause. The agitation had no immediate 
effect, but the indignation which he aroused against Russian policy had much to do with the strong anti-Russian 
feeling which made the Crimean War possible.[PARAGRAPH:2]From England he went to the United States of 
America: there his reception was equally enthusiastic, if less dignified. Gradually, his autocratic style 
and uncompromising outlook destroyed any real influence among the expatriate community. Other Hungarian 
exiles protested against his appearing to claim to be the only national hero of the revolution. Count 
Casimir Batthy&#225;ny attacked him in The Times, and Szemere, who had been prime minister under him, 
published a bitter criticism of his acts and character, accusing him of arrogance, cowardice and duplicity. 
He soon returned to England, where he lived for eight years in close connection with Mazzini, by whom, 
with some misgiving, he was persuaded to join the Revolutionary Committee. Quarrels of a kind only too 
common among exiles followed. Hungarians were especially offended by his continuing use of the title 
of Regent. He watched with anxiety every opportunity of once more freeing his country from Austria. An 
attempt to organize a Hungarian legion during the Crimean War was stopped; but in 1859 he entered into 
negotiations with Napoleon III, left England for Italy, and began the organization of a Hungarian legion, 
which was to make a descent on the coast of Dalmatia. The Peace of Villafranca made this impossible.[PARAGRAPH:2]From 
then on, Kossuth remained in Italy. He refused to follow the other Hungarian patriots, who, under the 
lead of De&#225;k, negotiated the 1867 Compromise (Ausgleich), and the ensuing amnesty. It is doubted 
whether Emperor Franz Joseph would have allowed the amnesty to extend to Kossuth. Publicly, Kossuth remained 
unreconciled to the house of Habsburg, and committed to a fully independent state. Though elected to 
the Diet of 1867, he never took his seat. He continued to remain a widely popular figure, but did not 
allow his name to be associated with dissent or any political cause. A law of 1879, which deprived of 
citizenship all Hungarians who had voluntarily been absent ten years, was a bitter blow to him. He displayed 
no interest in benefitting from a further amnesty in 1880.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1890, a delegation of hungarian 
pilgrims in Turin recorded a short patriotic speech delivered by the elderly Lajos Kossuth. The original 
recording on two wax cylinders for the Edison phonograph survives to this day, although barely audible 
due to excess playback and unsuccessful early restoration attempts. Lajos Kossuth is the earliest born 
person in the world who has his voice preserved.[PARAGRAPH:2]He died in Turin on the 20th of March 1894; 
his body was taken to Budapest, where he was buried amid the mourning of the whole nation, M&#243;r J&#243;kai 
delivering the funeral oration. A bronze statue was erected, by public subscription, in the Kerepesi 
Cemetery. Many regard Kossuth as Hungary's purest patriot and greatest orator.</English>
		<French>[H1]Lajos Kossuth[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Regent of Hungary[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Kossuth was born at Monok, 
a small town in the county of Zemplen, the eldest of four children. His father belonged to minor nobility, 
had a small estate, and was an advocate by profession. His mother raised the family as strict Lutherans. 
Kossuth completed his education at the Calvinist college of S&#225;rospatak and the University of Pest-Buda 
(now Budapest). Aged nineteen, he entered his father's legal practice. He was popular locally, and, having 
been appointed steward to the countess Szapary, a widow with large estates, he became her voting representative 
in the county assembly and settled in Pest. He was subsequently dismissed on the grounds of using estate 
funds to pay a gambling debt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Shortly after his dismissal by Countess Szapary, Kossuth was 
appointed as deputy to Count Hunyady at the National Diet. The Diet met during 18251827 and 18321836 
in Pressburg, then capital of Hungary. Only the upper aristocracy could vote, however, and Kossuth took 
little part in the debates. At the time, a struggle to reassert a Hungarian national identity was beginning 
to emerge under able leaders  most notably Wessel&#233;nyi and the Sz&#233;chenyis. In part, this was 
also a struggle for reform against the stagnant Austrian government. Kossuth's duties to Count Hunyady 
included reporting on Diet proceedings in writing, as the Austrian government, fearing popular dissent, 
had banned published reports. The high quality of Kossuth's letters led to their being circulated in 
manuscript among other Liberal magnates. Readership demands turned his output into the editing of an 
organized parliamentary gazette; spreading his name and influence further. Orders from the Official Censor 
halted circulation by lithograph printing. Distribution in manuscript by post was forbidden by the government, 
although circulation by hand continued.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1836 the Diet was dissolved. Kossuth continued 
to report (in letter form), covering the debates of the county assemblies. This new-found publicity gave 
the assemblies national political prominence. Previously they had had little idea of each others' proceedings. 
His skilful embellishment of the speeches from the Liberals and Reformers further enhanced the impact 
of his newsletters. The government in vain attempted to suppress the letters, and other means having 
failed, he was in May 1837, with Wessel&#233;nyi and several others, arrested on a charge of high treason. 
After spending a year in prison at Buda awaiting trial, he was condemned to four more years' imprisonment. 
His strict confinement damaged his health, but he was allowed to read. He greatly increased his political 
knowledge, and also acquired, from the study of the Bible and Shakespeare, a thorough knowledge of English.[PARAGRAPH:2]The 
arrests had caused great indignation. The Diet, which reconvened in 1839, demanded the release of the 
prisoners, and refused to pass any government measures. Metternich long remained obdurate, but the danger 
of war in 1840 obliged him to give way. Wessel&#233;nyi had been broken by his imprisonment, but Kossuth, 
partly supported by the frequent visits of Teresa Meszleny, emerged from prison unbroken. Immediately 
after his release Kossuth and Meszleny were married, and she remained a firm supporter of his politics. 
The Roman Catholic priests refused to bless the marriage as Kossuth would not convert to Meszleny's religion. 
Resultingly, Kossuth became a firm defender of mixed marriages.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kossuth had now become a 
national icon. He regained full health in January 1841 and was appointed editor of Pesti H&#237;rlap, 
a new Liberal party newspaper. Notably, the government agreed to grant a licence. The paper achieved 
unprecedented success; soon reaching the then immense circulation of 7000 copies. A competing pro-government 
paper, Vil&#225;g, started up but it only served to increase Kossuth's visibility and add to the general 
political fervour.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sz&#233;chenyi, the great reformer, publicly warned Kossuth that his appeals 
to the passions of the people would lead the nation to revolution. Kossuth, undaunted, did not stop at 
the publicly reasoned reforms demanded by all Liberals: the abolition of entail, the abolition of feudal 
burdens and taxation of the nobles. He went on to broach the possibility of separating from Austria. 
By combining this nationalism with an insistence on the superiority of the Magyars to the Slavonic inhabitants 
of Hungary, he sowed the seeds of both the collapse of Hungary in 1849 and his own political demise.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 
1844, Kossuth was dismissed from Pesti H&#237;rlap after a dispute with the proprietor over salary. It 
is believed that the dispute was rooted in government intrigue. Kossuth was unable to obtain permission 
to start his own newspaper. In a personal interview Metternich offered to take him into the government 
service. Kossuth refused, and spent the next three years without a regular position. He continued to 
agitate on behalf of both political and commercial independence for Hungary. He adopted the economic 
principles of List, and was the founder of a "V&#233;degylet" society  whose members consumed only Hungarian 
produce. He also argued for the creation of a Hungarian port at Fiume.[PARAGRAPH:2]In autumn 1847, Kossuth 
was able to take his final key step. Due to the support of Lajos Batthy&#225;ny during a keenly fought 
campaign, he was elected to the new Diet as member for Pest. He proclaimed: "Now that I am a deputy, 
I will cease to be an agitator." He immediately became chief leader of the Extreme Liberals. Ferenc De&#225;k 
was absent. Batthy&#225;ny, Istv&#225;n Sz&#233;chenyi, Szemere and J&#243;zsef E&#246;tv&#246;s, his 
political rivals, felt that his personal ambition and egoism led him to assume the chief place, and to 
use his parliamentary position to establish himself as leader of the nation; but before his eloquence 
and energy all apprehensions were useless. His eloquence was of that nature, in its impassioned appeals 
to the strongest emotions, that it required for its full effect the highest themes and the most dramatic 
situations. In a time of rest, though he could never have been obscure, he would never have attained 
the highest power. It was therefore a necessity of his nature, perhaps unconsciously, always to drive 
things to a crisis.[PARAGRAPH:2]The crisis came, and he used it to the full. On March 3, 1848, shortly 
after the news of the revolution in Paris had arrived, in a speech of surpassing power he demanded parliamentary 
government for Hungary and constitutional government for the rest of Austria. He appealed to the hope 
of the Habsburgs, "our beloved Archduke Franz Joseph" (then 17 years old), to perpetuate the ancient 
glory of the dynasty by meeting half-way the aspirations of a free people. He at once became the leader 
of the European revolution; his speech was read aloud in the streets of Vienna to the mob by which Metternich 
was overthrown (March 13), and when a deputation from the Diet visited Vienna to receive the assent of 
Emperor Ferdinand to their petition it was Kossuth who received the chief ovation. Batthy&#225;ny, who 
formed the first responsible government, appointed Kossuth the Minister of Finance.[PARAGRAPH:2]With 
amazing energy he began developing the internal resources of the country: re-establishing a separate 
Hungarian coinage, and using every means to increase national self-consciousness Characteristically, 
the new Hungarian bank notes had Kossuth's name as the most prominent inscription; making reference to 
"Kossuth Notes" a future byword. A new paper was started, to which was given the name of Kossuth H&#237;rlapja, 
so that from the first it was Kossuth rather than the Palatine or the president of the ministry whose 
name was in the minds of the people associated with the new government. Much more was this the case when, 
in the summer, the dangers from the Croats, Serbs and the reaction at Vienna increased. In a great speech 
July 11 he asked that the nation should arm in self-defence, and demanded 200,000 men; amid a scene of 
wild enthusiasm this was granted by acclamation. When Jellachich was marching on Pest he went from town 
to town rousing the people to the defence of the country, and the popular force of the Honv&#233;d was 
his creation. When Batthy&#225;ny resigned he was appointed with Szemere to carry on the government provisionally, 
and at the end of September he was made President of the Committee of National Defence.[PARAGRAPH:2]From 
this time he was a virtual dictator. The direction of the whole government was in his hands. Without 
military experience, he had to control and direct the movements of armies; he was unable to keep control 
over the generals or to establish that military co-operation so essential to success. Art&#250;r G&#246;rgey 
in particular, whose great abilities Kossuth was the first to recognize, refused obedience; the two men 
were very different personalities. Twice Kossuth deposed him from the command; twice he had to restore 
him. It would have been well if Kossuth had had something more of G&#246;rgey's calculated ruthlessness, 
for, as has been truly said, the revolutionary power he had seized could only be held by revolutionary 
means; but he was by nature soft-hearted and always merciful; though often audacious, he lacked decision 
in dealing with men. It has been said that he showed a want of personal courage; this is not improbable, 
the excess of feeling which made him so great an orator could hardly be combined with the coolness in 
danger required of a soldier; but no one was able, as he was, to infuse courage into others.[PARAGRAPH:2]During 
all the terrible winter which followed, his energy and spirit never failed him. It was he who overcame 
the reluctance of the army to march to the relief of Vienna; after the defeat of Schwechat, at which 
he was present, he sent Bern to carry on the war in Transylvania. At the end of the year, when the Austrians 
were approaching Pest, he asked for the mediation of Mr Stiles, the American envoy. Windisch-Gr&#228;tz, 
however, refused all terms, and the Diet and government fled to Debrecen, Kossuth taking with him the 
Crown of St Stephen, the sacred emblem of the Hungarian nation. In November 1848, Emperor Ferdinand abdicated 
in favour of Franz Joseph. The new Emperor revoked all the concessions granted in March and outlawed 
Kossuth and his colleagues. In April 1849, when the Hungarians had won many successes, after sounding

between him and those who wished only for autonomy under the old dynasty, and his enemies did not scruple 
to accuse him of aiming for Kingship. For the time the future form of government was left undecided, 
but Kossuth was appointed Regent. The hopes of ultimate success were frustrated by the intervention of

Kossuth (19.09.1802 in Monok, gest. 20.03.1894 in Turin) war Politiker und ein bedeutender ungarischer 
Freiheitsk&#228;mpfer, der sich bis zu seinem Tod f&#252;r die Unabh&#228;ngigkeit Ungarns von der Donaumonarchie 
&#214;sterreich (ab 1867 &#214;sterreich-Ungarn) einsetzte. Seit 1825 war Kossuth, beruflich Rechtsanwalt, 
mehrere Jahre ungarischer Landtagsabgeordneter des nationalliberalen Fl&#252;gels (1825 bis 1827; 1832 
bis 1836; 1847/1848). Nach seinem zweiten Landtagsmandat wurde er 1837 verhaftet und wegen Hochverrat 
zu Festungshaft verurteilt. Der Grund daf&#252;r war die Ver&#246;ffentlichung seiner Beobachtungen zur 
politischen Situation. Nach seiner Haft gab Kossuth die nationalliberale Zeitung Pesti H&#237;rlap heraus, 
deren Chefredakteur er war. Zu Beginn der M&#228;rzrevolution 1848 im Kaiserreich &#214;sterreich forderte 
er in einer am 3. M&#228;rz 1848 verfassten Rede die konstitutionelle Umwandlung der Monarchie sowie 
Verfassungen f&#252;r die &#246;sterreichischen L&#228;nder. Im Verlauf der Revolution radikalisierte 
er seine Vorstellungen bis hin zur Forderung nach Unabh&#228;ngigkeit Ungarns. 1848 war er in der ersten 
eigenst&#228;ndigen ungarischen Regierung unter dem liberalen Ministerpr&#228;sident Lajos Batthy&#225;ny 
Finanzminister und Vorsitzender des Verteidigungsausschusses. Als pr&#228;gende Kraft dieser Regierung 
setzte er Reformen wie beispielsweise die Bauernbefreiung um. Er baute ein ungarisches Freiwilligenheer 
(Honv&#233;d) gegen die Aufst&#228;nde der nichtmagyarischen Volksgruppen auf, das vor allem die Kroaten 
unter der F&#252;hrung von Josip Ban Jelacic in Schach halten sollte, die ihre eigene Unabh&#228;ngigkeit 
in der ungarischen Reichsh&#228;lfte verfolgten. Nach dem R&#252;cktritt des &#246;sterreichischen Kaisers 
Ferdinand I. als Folge der revolution&#228;ren Ereignisse in &#214;sterreich seit M&#228;rz 1848 verweigerte 
Ungarn dessen Nachfolger Franz Joseph I. im Dezember 1848 die ungarische K&#246;nigskrone. Als der Kaiser 
am 7. M&#228;rz 1849 eine Verfassung oktroyieren wollte, kam es zum ungarischen Unabh&#228;ngigkeitsaufstand 
gegen &#214;sterreich, bis Kossuth am 14. April 1849 die Unabh&#228;ngigkeit Ungarns ausrief. Kossuth 
wurde zum ungarischen Reichsverweser gew&#228;hlt und hatte als solcher diktatorische Vollmachten. Die 
ungarische Revolutionsarmee, die durch Freischaren und polnische Emigranten verst&#228;rkt wurde, konnte 
die einmarschierte &#246;sterreichische Armee zun&#228;chst zur&#252;ckdr&#228;ngen. Schlie&#223;lich 
gelang es &#214;sterreich nur mit Beistand von Russland, den ungarischen Freiheitskampf zu ersticken. 
Nach der Niederschlagung der ungarischen Revolution wurden 13 Gener&#228;le und Offiziere in Arad sowie 
der ehemalige Ministerpr&#228;sident Batthy&#225;nyi am 6. Oktober 1849, dem ersten Jahrestag der zweiten 
Wiener Revolution, in Pest hingerichtet. Lajos Kossuth konnte ins Exil fliehen und ging zun&#228;chst 
ins Osmanische Reich. Nach mehreren Stationen seines Exils trat er in London den Freimaurern bei. Sp&#228;ter 
folgte er  Giuseppe Mazzini nach Italien, wo er seinen Kampf f&#252;r (nicht nur) Ungarns Unabh&#228;ngigkeit 
fortsetzte. Unter anderem stellte er dabei auch eine ungarische Legion auf, die unter Giuseppe Garibaldi 
in den oberitalienischen Unabh&#228;ngigkeitsk&#228;mpfen des Risorgimento gegen &#214;sterreich zu Felde 
zog. 1867 wurde Lajos Kossuth im Rahmen des &#246;sterreichisch-ungarischen Ausgleichs amnestiert. Als 
Gegner dieses Ausgleichs verblieb Kossuth aber im italienischen Exil. Ohne sein Ziel zu Lebzeiten erreicht 
zu haben, starb er am 20. M&#228;rz 1894 im Alter von 91 Jahren in Turin. Kossuth erfuhr nach seinem 
Tod sp&#228;te Rehabilitation durch &#214;sterreich. Kaiser Franz Joseph I. lie&#223; den Leichnam feierlich 
nach Budapest &#252;berf&#252;hren, wo er unter Anteilnahme einer gro&#223;en Menschenmenge beigesetzt wurde.</German>

19 settembre 1802;[BOLD] morto il:[\BOLD] 20 marzo 1894[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Storia:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Kossuth 
nacque a Monok, un piccolo paese nella contea di Zemplen, primo di quattro figli. Suo padre era membro 
della bassa nobilt&#224;, possedeva una piccola propriet&#224; e di professione era avvocato. Sua madre 
educ&#242; i figli secondo un rigida disciplina luterana. Kossuth complet&#242; la sua educazione al 
collegio calvinista di S&#225;rospatak e all'Universit&#224; di Pest-Buda (oggi Budapest). All'et&#224; 
di diciannove anni entr&#242; come praticante nello studio legale di suo padre. Kossuth era un personaggio 
popolare a livello locale, ed essendo stato assegnato come assistente alla contessa Szap&#225;ry, una 
vedova con grandi proprieta terriere, divenne suo rappresentante nell'assemblea di contea e si stabil&#236; 
a Pest. Successivamente fu licenziato per aver utilizzato i fondi della propriet&#224; per pagare debiti 
di gioco.[PARAGRAPH:2]Poco dopo il suo licenziamento da parte della contessa Szap&#225;ry, Kossuth fu 
eletto deputato per la contea di Hunyady alla Dieta Nazionale. Le Dieta, nel 1825-1827 e nel 1832-1836, 
si tenne a Presburgo (oggi Bratislava), all'epoca capitale d'Ungheria. Ad ogni modo solo l'alta aristocrazia 
poteva votare per cui Kossuth ebbe soltanto un piccolo ruolo durante i dibattiti. In quel periodo inizi&#242; 
a prendere vita una battaglia volta a riaffermare l'identit&#224; nazionale ungherese ad opera di alcuni 
validi leader - sopprattutto Wessel&#233;nyi e Sz&#233;chenyi. In parte, questa era anche una battaglia 
per le riforme contro la stagnazione del governo centrale austriaco. I doveri di Kossuth verso la contea 
di Hunyady includevano anche la redazione scritta di rapporti periodici riguardanti il procedere dei 
lavori alla Dieta, ma il governo austriaco, temendo il dissenso popolare, imped&#236; la pubblicazione 
a stampa di quei rapporti. Lo stile colto delle lettere di Kossuth fece s&#236;, per&#242;, che queste 
venissero fatte circolare sotto forma di manoscritti fra gli altri nobili liberali. Costoro gli chiesero 
di pubblicare la sua produzione letteraria sotto forma di una gazzetta parlamentare; il che gli forn&#236; 
ancora pi&#249; notoriet&#224; ed influenza politica. Gli ordini dell'Ufficiale Censore bloccarono la 
circolazione delle stampe litografate cos&#236; come la spedizione via posta del manoscritto, tuttavia 
alcune copie continuarono a circolare clandestinamente.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nel 1836 la Dieta fu sciolta. Kossuth 
continu&#242; a riportare (in forma scritta) i testi dei dibattiti delle assemblee di contea. Grazie 
a ci&#242; le assemblee ottennero una pubblicit&#224; inedita e rilevanza politica a livello nazionale. 
Prima di allora ognuna di esse aveva solo una vaga idea di come lavorassero le altre. L'abilit&#224; 
di Kossuth nell'abbellire i discorsi dei liberali e dei riformatori aumentarono ancor di pi&#249; l'impatto 
di queste lettere; il governo invano cerc&#242; di farle sparire, ed, avendo fallito, nel maggio del 
1837 dispose l'arresto di Kossuth, assieme a Wessel&#233;nyi ed alcuni altri, con l'accusa di alto tradimento. 
Dopo aver atteso per un anno in carcere a Buda il processo, Kossuth fu infine condannato ad altri quattro 
anni di prigione. Il duro isolamento a cui fu sottoposto minarono la sua salute, anche se gli fu permesso 
di leggere. Grazie ai suoi studi, miglior&#242; la sua cultura politica, ed acquis&#236;, grazie allo 
studio della Bibbia e di Shakespeare, una profonda conoscenza dell'inglese.[PARAGRAPH:2]Quegli arresti 
avevano causato grande indignazione: la Dieta, che fu riconvocata nel 1839, chiese il rilascio dei prigionieri, 
e rifiut&#242; di approvare ogni delibera del governo. Metternich, a lungo inflessibile, a causa delle 
difficolt&#224; della guerra, nel 1840 si convinse a dare ascolto alle proteste. Wessel&#233;nyi usc&#236; 
dal carcere completamente distrutto ma Kossuth, in parte confortato dalle frequenti visite di Teresa 
Meszleny, non perse le sue energie. Immediatamente dopo il rilascio, Kossuth e Meszleny si sposarono, 
e lei rimase sempre un valido supporto alla sua politica. Il clero della Chiesa Romana Cattolica rifiut&#242; 
di benedire il matrimonio poich&#233; Kossuth si rifiut&#242; di convertirsi alla religione di Meszleny 
(come detto, era luterano). Come risultato, Kossuth divenne un fermo sostenitore dei matrimoni misti.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kossuth 
ora era diventato un'icona nazionale. Si ristabil&#236; completamente dal carcere nel gennaio del 1841 
e fu assunto come editore del "Pesti H&#237;rlap", un nuovo giornale del partito liberale; sorprendentemte 
il governo gli concesse una licenza. Il giornale ebbe un successo senza precedenti; raggiunse immediatamente 
la ragguardevole quota (per allora) di 7000 copie. Un giornale filogovernativo, il "Vil&#225;g", fu fondato 
nello stesso periodo ma ci&#242; serv&#236; solo ad incrementare la popolarit&#224; di Kossuth e del 
suo fervore politico.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sz&#233;chenyi, il grande riformatore, avvert&#236; pubblicamente Kossuth 
che il suo appellarsi alle passioni del popolo avrebbe portato la nazione verso la rivoluzione. Kossuth, 
imperterrito, non si ferm&#242; dal sostenere pubblicamente le ragioni delle riforme chieste da tutti 
i liberali: l'abolizione dell'inalienabilita delle eredita nobiliari e dei privilegi feudali e la tassazione 
dei nobili. Egli fu sul punto di prendere in considerazione la possibilit&#224; di separazione dell'Ungheria 
dall'Austria. Combinando questo suo nazionalismo con l'insistenza ad affermare la superiorit&#224; dei 
magiari sugli slavi che abitavano l'Ungheria, egli piant&#242; i semi sia del collasso dell'Ungheria 
nel 1849 sia della propria dipartita politica.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nel 1844 Kossuth fu licenziato dal Pesti H&#237;rlap 
dopo una discussione col proprietario sul suo salario. Si crede per&#242; che il litigio sia stato fomentato 
da intrighi governativi, tant'&#232; che a Kossuth non fu in seguito concessa la licenza per fondare 
un suo giornale. In un colloquio personale, Metternich gli offr&#236; un incarico governativo, ma Kossuth 
rifiut&#242;; a causa di ci&#242; rimase per tre anni senza lavoro. Egli continu&#242; comunque nella 
sua attivit&#224; di agitatore nel nome dell'indipendenza politica e commerciale dell'Ungheria. Adott&#242; 
i principi economici teorizzati dal tedesco Friedrich List, e fondo la societ&#242; "V&#233;degylet", 
i cui membri consumavano solo prodotti ungheresi. Cerc&#242; anche di organizzare la creazione di un 
porto ungherese a Fiume.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nell'autunnno del 1847, Kossuth ebbe la possibilit&#224; di mettere 
in pratica le sue idee. Grazie al supporto di Lajos Batthy&#225;ny, nel corso di una campagna combattuta 
aspramente, fu eletto alla nuova Dieta come rappresentante di Pest. Egli dichiaro: &#171;ora che sono 
un deputato, smettero di essere un agitatore&#187;. Immediatamente divenne il capo degli estremisti liberali, 
non essendo presente alla Dieta in quel periodo Ferenc De&#225;k. Batthy&#225;ny, Sz&#233;chenyi, Szemere 
and E&#246;tv&#246;s, i suoi rivali politici, si resero conto che le sue personali ambizioni ed il suo 
egoismo lo avevano portato in una posizione di preminenza, e che avrebbe usato questa posizione per assumere 
il controllo della nazione; ma davanti alla sua eloquenza e alla sua energia tutte le opposizioni erano 
inutili. Kossuth, con la sua tecnica oratoria, al fine di ottenere un risultato migliore, faceva ricorso, 
nel suo appellarsi alle emozioni pi&#249; intense, a temi di elevato spessore etico e ad immagini dall'effetto 
drammatico. Ciononostante egli non amb&#236; mai e non ottenne mai il potere assoluto. Una caratteristica 
della sua natura, invece, forse inconscia, era quella di condurre tutto verso la crisi.[PARAGRAPH:2]La 
crisi arriv&#242;, e lui la sfrutt&#242; al massimo. Il 3 marzo 1848, appena giunta la notizia della 
sommossa a Parigi, chiese con forza un governo parlamentare per l'Ungheria ed un governo costituzionale 
per il resto dell'Austria. Egli confidava nel fatto che gli Asburgo, nella persona del "nostro amato 
arciduca Francesco Giuseppe" (allora diciassettenne), accettassero di perpetuare l'antica gloria della 
dinastia venendo incontro almeno in parte alle aspirazioni di un popolo alla libert&#224;. Egli divenne 
in quel momento il leader della rivoluzione in tutta Europa; le sue parole furono lette ad alta voce 
nelle strade di Vienna da una folla inferocita che chiese ed ottenne il rovesciamento di Metternich (13 
marzo), e quando una delegazione della Dieta giunse a Vienna per ricevere l'assenso dell'imperatore Ferdinando 
alle loro petizioni, le ovazioni pi&#249; calorose furono per Kossuth. Batthy&#225;ny, che form&#242; 
il primo governo parlamentare, nomin&#242; Kossuth Ministro dell'economia.[PARAGRAPH:2]Con incredibile 
energia egli inizi&#242; la sua opera di sfruttamento delle risorse interne del paese: reistitu&#236; 
una moneta nazionale all'Ungheria, ed us&#242; ogni mezzo per promuovere il sentimento nazionale di appartenenza. 
Come caratteristica, le nuove banconote ungheresi avevano il nome di Kossuth come iscrizione pi&#249; 
in evidenza e venivano chiamate "le banconote di Kossuth", espressione che in futuro sarebbe diventata 
un proverbio. Usc&#236; alle stampe un nuovo giornale, a cui fu dato il nome di Kossuth H&#237;rlapja, 
cosicch&#233; fu quello di Kossuth piuttosto che quello del Funzionario Imperiale o del Presidente dei 
Ministri il primo nome associato dal popolo al nuovo governo. Molto pi&#249; importante fu la circostanza 
in cui, in estate, le minacce da parte dei croati e dei serbi nonch&#233; la reazione di Vienna aumentarono. 
In un grande discorso l'11 luglio, egli incit&#242; la nazione ad armarsi per la propria difesa e chiese 
l'arruolamento di 200.000 uomini; tra scene di grande entusiasmo, la richiesta di Kossuth fu approvata 
per acclamazione. Quando il croato Josip Jelacic marci&#242; su Pest egli and&#242; di paese in paese 
per aizzare il popolo alla difesa del suolo patrio; fu cos&#236; che venne creata l'armata popolare "Honv&#233;d". 
Quando Batthy&#225;ny si dimise, Kossuth ebbe in concomitanza con Szemere l'incarico di guidare provvisoriamente 
il governo, e alla fine di Settembre fu nominato Presidente del Comitato per la Difesa Nazionale. [PARAGRAPH:2]Da 
questo momento egli divenne virtualmente un dittatore. La direzione dell'intero governo fin&#236; nelle 
sue mani. Senza esperienza militare, egli dovette controllare e dirigere i movimenti delle armate; non 
riusc&#236; infatti a mantenere sotto controllo i generali o a comprendere che la cooperazione militare 
&#232; essenziale per il successo. Art&#250;r G&#246;rgey in particolare, le cui grandi abilit&#224; 
Kossuth fu il primo ad individuare, rifiut&#242; di obbedire; i due uomini avevano personalit&#224; molto 
diverse. Due volte Kossuth lo sollev&#242; dal comando; due volte dovette reinsediarlo. Forse sarebbe 
stato un bene se Kossuth avesse avuto un pizzico della spietatezza calcolata di G&#246;rgey, giacch&#233;, 
come si vide in effetti, il potere rivoluzionario che egli aveva ottenuto sarebbe potuto essere mantenuto 
solo con metodi rivoluzionari; ma Kossuth era per natura di cuore teneto e clemente in ogni occasione; 
sebbene spesso dimostrasse audacia, gli manc&#242; la determinatezza nel mettersi d'accordo coi suoi 
uomini. E' stato detto che egli si dimostr&#242; privo di coraggio personale; questo non &#232; improbabile, 
l'eccesso di focosit&#224; che fece di lui un cos&#236; grande oratore difficilmente potrebbe combinarsi 
col sangue freddo richiesto da un soldato in caso di pericolo; tuttavia nessuno fu capace quanto lui 
di infondere coraggio negli altri.[PARAGRAPH:2]Durante il terribile inverno che segu&#236;, la sua energia 
ed il suo spirito non si raffreddarono mai. Fu lui che vinse la riluttanza dell'esercito a marciare alla 
volta di Vienna; dopo la sconfitta di Schwechat (alle porte di Vienna), alla quale lui fu presente, invi&#242; 
Bern come supporto nella guerra in Transilvania. Alla fine dell'anno, quando gli Austriaci stavano raggiungendo 
Pest, chiese la mediazione dell'inviato americano Stiles. Ciononostante il generale austriaco Windisch-Gr&#228;tz 
rifiut&#242; ogni trattativa, costringendo la Dieta ed il governo a fuggire a Debrecen; Kossuth port&#242; 
con s&#233; la corona di Santo Stefano, il sacro emblema della nazione ungherese. Nel novembre del 1848, 
l'Imperatore Ferdinando abdic&#242; in favore di Francesco Giuseppe. Il nuovo Imperatore revoc&#242; 
tutte le concessioni fatte a marzo e dichiar&#242; fuorilegge Kossuth e i suoi colleghi. In aprile, dopo 
che gli ungheresi ottennero alcuni successi militari grazie ad un esercito tornato in forze, Kossuth 
proclam&#242; l'indipendenza ungherese con una dichiarazione ufficiale in cui veniva affermato che "la 
Casa degli Asburgo-Lorena, spergiura al cospetto di Dio e dell'Uomo, ha perso il trono ungherese." Questo 
fu un passo che evidenzia la sua predilezione per le azioni estreme e drammatiche, ma questa volta si 
crearono anche dei dissensi fra lui e coloro che desideravano soltanto un'autonomia di fatto sotto la 
vecchia dinastia; i suoi nemici, poi, non si lasciarono scappare l'occasione di accusarlo di mirare alla 
corona ungherese. Al momento, la futura forma di governo non era ancora stata decisa, anche se Kossuth 
fu dichiarato Reggente. Le speranze di successo vennero per&#242; frustrate dall'intervento della Russia; 
tutti gli appelli alle potenze occidentali furono vani, e l'11 agosto Kossuth abdic&#242; in favore di 
G&#246;rgey, sulla base del fatto che in quella situazione estrema solo un generale avrebbe potuto salvare 
la nazione. G&#246;rgey a Vil&#225;gos si arrese ai russi, i quali consegnarono il suo esercito agli 
austriaci. G&#246;rgey fu risparmiato, grazie alle insistenze dei russi, ma il resto dell'esercito ungherese 
fu fatto oggetto di pesanti rappresaglie. Kossuth con fermezza sostenne fino alla sua morte che G&#246;rgey 
fu il solo responsabile per quella umiliazione.[PARAGRAPH:2]La carriera di Kossuth era al termine. Ritrovatosi 
ad essere un fuggiasco solitario, attravers&#242; la frontiera turca e ricevette ospitalit&#224; dalle 
autorit&#224; locali, le quali, supportate dall'Inghilterra e malgrado gli accordi con gli imperatori 
alleati, rifiutarono di consegnare lui e gli altri fuggiaschi all'Austria. Nel gennaio del 1849 fu trasferito 
da Vidin (nell'odierna Bulgaria nord-occidentale), dove lui era stato tenuto agli arresti domiciliari, 
a Shumla, e quindi a Katahia in Asia minore. Qui si ricongiunse coi figli, che erano stati confinati 
a Presburgo (Bratislava); sua moglie (che aveva una taglia sulla testa) lo aveva raggiunto poco prima, 
essendo scappata grazie ad un travestimento.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nel settembre del 1851 gli fu permesso di lasciare 
la Turchia a bordo di un vascello militare americano. Egli dapprima approd&#242; a Marsiglia, dove ricevette 
un'accoglienza entusiastica dalla gente, ma dove il Principe-Presidente Luigi Napoleone Bonaparte rifiut&#242; 
di accordargli il permesso di attraversare la Francia. Il 23 ottobre approd&#242; a Southampton e trascorse 
tre settimane in Inghilterra, dove fu ancora una volta acclamato. Gli fu concesso di tenere dei discorsi 
a Southampton, Birmingham ed in altre citta; fu ufficialmente ospite del sindaco di Londra e in ogni 
occasione fece valere la sua eloquenza in inglese parlando della causa ungherese. Gli effetti di quanto 
disse non furono immediati, ma l'indignazione che lui riusc&#236; a far esplodere contro la politica 
russa ha molti legami con i forti sentimenti anti-russi che furono alla base della guerra di Crimea.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dall'Inghilterra 
si trasfer&#236; negli Stati Uniti d'America: l&#236; l'accoglienza fu ugualmente entusiastica, anche 
se meno "dignitosa". Gradualmente, il suo stile autocratico e alieno a compromessi distrusse ogni reale 
influenza all'interno della comunit&#224; di espatriati. Gli altri esuli ungheresi protestavano contro 
la sua apparente pretesa di essere l'unico eroe della rivoluzione. Il conte Kasimir Batthy&#225;ny lo 
attacc&#242; sul Times, e Szemere, che era stato primo ministro sotto la sua reggenza, pubblic&#242; 
un articolo in cui critic&#242; aspramente le sue azioni e il suo carattere, accusandolo di arroganza, 
codardia e ambivalenza. Kossuth ritorn&#242; presto in Inghilterra, dove visse per otto anni in stretti 
rapporti con Mazzini, da cui, nonostante alcuni timori, fu persuaso ad unirsi al comitato rivoluzionario. 
Continuarono per&#242; le frizioni fra lui e gli altri esuli ungheresi, offesi in particolar modo dal 
suo continuare ad utilizzare il titolo di Reggente. Kossuth teneva d'occhio con ansiet&#224; ogni opportunit&#224; 
di liberare una volta per tutte il suo paese dall'Austria. Un tentativo di organizzare una legione ungherese 
durante la guerra di Crimea fu interrotto, ma nel 1859 riusc&#236; ad aprire dei negoziati con Napoleone 
III; lasci&#242; l'Inghilterra per l'Italia ed inizi&#242; ad organizzare un'altra legione ungherese, 
con la quale intendeva scendere lungo le coste della Dalmazia. La pace di Villafranca rese tutto questo 
impossibile.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nonostante questo episodio, Kossuth rimase in Italia. Rifiut&#242; di seguire 
gli altri patrioti ungheresi, che, grazie alle trattative di Ferenc De&#225;k, negoziarono il "Compromesso" 
del 1867 (Ausgleich/Kiegyez&#233;s) ed ottennero l'amnistia. E' in dubbio se l'Imperatore Francesco Giuseppe 
avrebbe acconsentito ad estendere l'amnistia a Kossuth. Ufficialmente, Kossuth non si riconcili&#242; 
mai con la casa d'Asburgo, e si adoper&#242; sempre per uno stato completamente independente. Sebbene 
eletto alla Dieta del 1867, egli non si insedi&#242; mai. Continu&#242; a rimanere una figura molto popolare, 
ma il suo nome non fu pi&#249; associato ad alcuna manifestazione di dissenso di qualsiasi natura politica. 
Una legge del 1879, che privava della cittadinanza tutti gli ungheresi che si erano volontariamente assentati 
dal paese per pi&#249; di dieci anni, fu per lui un boccone amaro. Egli non mostr&#242; interesse a beneficiare 
di un'ulteriore amnistia nel 1880.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nel 1890, una delegazione di pellegrini ungheresi a Torino 
registrarono un piccolo messaggio patriottico dell'ormai anziano Lajos Kossuth. La registrazione originale 
effettuata con il fonografo di Edison esiste ancora al giorno d'oggi, sebbene scarsamente udibile a causa 
degli eccessivi ascolti effettuati e dei falliti tentativi di restaurazione. Lajos Kossuth e la pi&#249; 
antica persona al mondo che abbia la sua voce ancora registrata e conservata.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mor&#236; a 
Torino il 20 Marzo 1894; il suo corpo &#232; stato portato a Budapest, dove fu stato seppellito mentre 
nell'intera nazione fu dichiarato il lutto nazionale. M&#243;r J&#243;kai tenne il discorso funebre. 
Grazie ad una sottoscrizione pubblica, fu eretta una statua di bronzo nel cimetero di Kerepesi. Molti 
ricordano Kossuth come uno dei pi&#249; puri patrioti d'Ungheria nonch&#233; il pi&#249; grande fra gli 
oratori.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Lajos Kossuth[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Regent of Hungary[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Kossuth was born at 
Monok, a small town in the county of Zemplen, the eldest of four children. His father belonged to minor 
nobility, had a small estate, and was an advocate by profession. His mother raised the family as strict 
Lutherans. Kossuth completed his education at the Calvinist college of S&#225;rospatak and the University 
of Pest-Buda (now Budapest). Aged nineteen, he entered his father's legal practice. He was popular locally, 
and, having been appointed steward to the countess Szapary, a widow with large estates, he became her 
voting representative in the county assembly and settled in Pest. He was subsequently dismissed on the 
grounds of using estate funds to pay a gambling debt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Shortly after his dismissal by Countess 
Szapary, Kossuth was appointed as deputy to Count Hunyady at the National Diet. The Diet met during 18251827 
and 18321836 in Pressburg, then capital of Hungary. Only the upper aristocracy could vote, however, 
and Kossuth took little part in the debates. At the time, a struggle to reassert a Hungarian national 
identity was beginning to emerge under able leaders  most notably Wessel&#233;nyi and the Sz&#233;chenyis. 
In part, this was also a struggle for reform against the stagnant Austrian government. Kossuth's duties 
to Count Hunyady included reporting on Diet proceedings in writing, as the Austrian government, fearing 
popular dissent, had banned published reports. The high quality of Kossuth's letters led to their being 
circulated in manuscript among other Liberal magnates. Readership demands turned his output into the 
editing of an organized parliamentary gazette; spreading his name and influence further. Orders from 
the Official Censor halted circulation by lithograph printing. Distribution in manuscript by post was 
forbidden by the government, although circulation by hand continued.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1836 the Diet was 
dissolved. Kossuth continued to report (in letter form), covering the debates of the county assemblies. 
This new-found publicity gave the assemblies national political prominence. Previously they had had little 
idea of each others' proceedings. His skilful embellishment of the speeches from the Liberals and Reformers 
further enhanced the impact of his newsletters. The government in vain attempted to suppress the letters, 
and other means having failed, he was in May 1837, with Wessel&#233;nyi and several others, arrested 
on a charge of high treason. After spending a year in prison at Buda awaiting trial, he was condemned 
to four more years' imprisonment. His strict confinement damaged his health, but he was allowed to read. 
He greatly increased his political knowledge, and also acquired, from the study of the Bible and Shakespeare, 
a thorough knowledge of English.[PARAGRAPH:2]The arrests had caused great indignation. The Diet, which 
reconvened in 1839, demanded the release of the prisoners, and refused to pass any government measures. 
Metternich long remained obdurate, but the danger of war in 1840 obliged him to give way. Wessel&#233;nyi 
had been broken by his imprisonment, but Kossuth, partly supported by the frequent visits of Teresa Meszleny, 
emerged from prison unbroken. Immediately after his release Kossuth and Meszleny were married, and she 
remained a firm supporter of his politics. The Roman Catholic priests refused to bless the marriage as 
Kossuth would not convert to Meszleny's religion. Resultingly, Kossuth became a firm defender of mixed 
marriages.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kossuth had now become a national icon. He regained full health in January 1841 
and was appointed editor of Pesti H&#237;rlap, a new Liberal party newspaper. Notably, the government 
agreed to grant a licence. The paper achieved unprecedented success; soon reaching the then immense circulation 
of 7000 copies. A competing pro-government paper, Vil&#225;g, started up but it only served to increase 
Kossuth's visibility and add to the general political fervour.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sz&#233;chenyi, the great 
reformer, publicly warned Kossuth that his appeals to the passions of the people would lead the nation 
to revolution. Kossuth, undaunted, did not stop at the publicly reasoned reforms demanded by all Liberals: 
the abolition of entail, the abolition of feudal burdens and taxation of the nobles. He went on to broach 
the possibility of separating from Austria. By combining this nationalism with an insistence on the superiority 
of the Magyars to the Slavonic inhabitants of Hungary, he sowed the seeds of both the collapse of Hungary 
in 1849 and his own political demise.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1844, Kossuth was dismissed from Pesti H&#237;rlap 
after a dispute with the proprietor over salary. It is believed that the dispute was rooted in government 
intrigue. Kossuth was unable to obtain permission to start his own newspaper. In a personal interview 
Metternich offered to take him into the government service. Kossuth refused, and spent the next three 
years without a regular position. He continued to agitate on behalf of both political and commercial 
independence for Hungary. He adopted the economic principles of List, and was the founder of a "V&#233;degylet" 
society  whose members consumed only Hungarian produce. He also argued for the creation of a Hungarian 
port at Fiume.[PARAGRAPH:2]In autumn 1847, Kossuth was able to take his final key step. Due to the support 
of Lajos Batthy&#225;ny during a keenly fought campaign, he was elected to the new Diet as member for 
Pest. He proclaimed: "Now that I am a deputy, I will cease to be an agitator." He immediately became 
chief leader of the Extreme Liberals. Ferenc De&#225;k was absent. Batthy&#225;ny, Istv&#225;n Sz&#233;chenyi, 
Szemere and J&#243;zsef E&#246;tv&#246;s, his political rivals, felt that his personal ambition and egoism 
led him to assume the chief place, and to use his parliamentary position to establish himself as leader 
of the nation; but before his eloquence and energy all apprehensions were useless. His eloquence was 
of that nature, in its impassioned appeals to the strongest emotions, that it required for its full effect 
the highest themes and the most dramatic situations. In a time of rest, though he could never have been 
obscure, he would never have attained the highest power. It was therefore a necessity of his nature, 
perhaps unconsciously, always to drive things to a crisis.[PARAGRAPH:2]The crisis came, and he used it 
to the full. On March 3, 1848, shortly after the news of the revolution in Paris had arrived, in a speech 
of surpassing power he demanded parliamentary government for Hungary and constitutional government for 
the rest of Austria. He appealed to the hope of the Habsburgs, "our beloved Archduke Franz Joseph" (then 
17 years old), to perpetuate the ancient glory of the dynasty by meeting half-way the aspirations of 
a free people. He at once became the leader of the European revolution; his speech was read aloud in 
the streets of Vienna to the mob by which Metternich was overthrown (March 13), and when a deputation 
from the Diet visited Vienna to receive the assent of Emperor Ferdinand to their petition it was Kossuth 
who received the chief ovation. Batthy&#225;ny, who formed the first responsible government, appointed 
Kossuth the Minister of Finance.[PARAGRAPH:2]With amazing energy he began developing the internal resources 
of the country: re-establishing a separate Hungarian coinage, and using every means to increase national 
self-consciousness Characteristically, the new Hungarian bank notes had Kossuth's name as the most prominent 
inscription; making reference to "Kossuth Notes" a future byword. A new paper was started, to which was 
given the name of Kossuth H&#237;rlapja, so that from the first it was Kossuth rather than the Palatine 
or the president of the ministry whose name was in the minds of the people associated with the new government. 
Much more was this the case when, in the summer, the dangers from the Croats, Serbs and the reaction 
at Vienna increased. In a great speech July 11 he asked that the nation should arm in self-defence, and 
demanded 200,000 men; amid a scene of wild enthusiasm this was granted by acclamation. When Jellachich 
was marching on Pest he went from town to town rousing the people to the defence of the country, and 
the popular force of the Honv&#233;d was his creation. When Batthy&#225;ny resigned he was appointed 
with Szemere to carry on the government provisionally, and at the end of September he was made President 
of the Committee of National Defence.[PARAGRAPH:2]From this time he was a virtual dictator. The direction 
of the whole government was in his hands. Without military experience, he had to control and direct the 
movements of armies; he was unable to keep control over the generals or to establish that military co-operation 
so essential to success. Art&#250;r G&#246;rgey in particular, whose great abilities Kossuth was the 
first to recognize, refused obedience; the two men were very different personalities. Twice Kossuth deposed 
him from the command; twice he had to restore him. It would have been well if Kossuth had had something 
more of G&#246;rgey's calculated ruthlessness, for, as has been truly said, the revolutionary power he 
had seized could only be held by revolutionary means; but he was by nature soft-hearted and always merciful; 
though often audacious, he lacked decision in dealing with men. It has been said that he showed a want 
of personal courage; this is not improbable, the excess of feeling which made him so great an orator 
could hardly be combined with the coolness in danger required of a soldier; but no one was able, as he 
was, to infuse courage into others.[PARAGRAPH:2]During all the terrible winter which followed, his energy 
and spirit never failed him. It was he who overcame the reluctance of the army to march to the relief 
of Vienna; after the defeat of Schwechat, at which he was present, he sent Bern to carry on the war in 
Transylvania. At the end of the year, when the Austrians were approaching Pest, he asked for the mediation 
of Mr Stiles, the American envoy. Windisch-Gr&#228;tz, however, refused all terms, and the Diet and government 
fled to Debrecen, Kossuth taking with him the Crown of St Stephen, the sacred emblem of the Hungarian 
nation. In November 1848, Emperor Ferdinand abdicated in favour of Franz Joseph. The new Emperor revoked 
all the concessions granted in March and outlawed Kossuth and his colleagues. In April 1849, when the 
Hungarians had won many successes, after sounding the army, he issued the celebrated declaration of Hungarian 
independence, in which he declared that "the house of Habsburg-Lorraine, perjured in the sight of God 
and man, had forfeited the Hungarian throne." It was a step characteristic of his love for extreme and 
dramatic action, but it added to the dissensions between him and those who wished only for autonomy under 
the old dynasty, and his enemies did not scruple to accuse him of aiming for Kingship. For the time the 
future form of government was left undecided, but Kossuth was appointed Regent. The hopes of ultimate 
success were frustrated by the intervention of Russia; all appeals to the western powers were vain, and 
on August 11 Kossuth abdicated in favor of G&#246;rgey, on the ground that in the last extremity the 
general alone could save the nation. G&#246;rgey capitulated at Vil&#225;gos to the Russians, who handed 
over the army to the Austrians. G&#246;rgey was spared  at the insistence of the Russians. Reprisals 
were taken on the rest of the Hungarian army. Kossuth steadfastly maintained until his death that G&#246;rgey 
alone was responsible for the humiliation.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kossuth's career was at an end. A solitary fugitive, 
he crossed the Turkish frontier. He was hospitably received by the Turkish authorities, who, supported 
by the British, refused, notwithstanding the threats of the allied emperors, to surrender him and other 
fugitives to Austria. In January 1849 he was removed from Vidin, where he had been kept under house arrest, 
to Shumla, and thence to Katahia in Asia Minor. Here he was joined by his children, who had been confined 
at Pozsony/Pressburg (Bratislava); his wife (a price had been set on her head) had joined him earlier, 
having escaped in disguise.[PARAGRAPH:2]In September 1851 he was allowed to leave Turkey on an American 
man-of-war. He first landed at Marseille, where he received an enthusiastic welcome from the people, 
but the Prince-President Louis Napoleon refused to allow him to cross France. On October 23 he landed 
at Southampton and spent three weeks in England, where he was generally feted. Addresses were presented 
to him at Southampton, Birmingham and other towns; he was officially entertained by the Lord Mayor of 
London; at each place he spoke eloquently in English for the Hungarian cause. The agitation had no immediate 
effect, but the indignation which he aroused against Russian policy had much to do with the strong anti-Russian 
feeling which made the Crimean War possible.[PARAGRAPH:2]From England he went to the United States of 
America: there his reception was equally enthusiastic, if less dignified. Gradually, his autocratic style 
and uncompromising outlook destroyed any real influence among the expatriate community. Other Hungarian 
exiles protested against his appearing to claim to be the only national hero of the revolution. Count 
Casimir Batthy&#225;ny attacked him in The Times, and Szemere, who had been prime minister under him, 
published a bitter criticism of his acts and character, accusing him of arrogance, cowardice and duplicity. 
He soon returned to England, where he lived for eight years in close connection with Mazzini, by whom, 
with some misgiving, he was persuaded to join the Revolutionary Committee. Quarrels of a kind only too 
common among exiles followed. Hungarians were especially offended by his continuing use of the title 
of Regent. He watched with anxiety every opportunity of once more freeing his country from Austria. An 
attempt to organize a Hungarian legion during the Crimean War was stopped; but in 1859 he entered into 
negotiations with Napoleon III, left England for Italy, and began the organization of a Hungarian legion, 
which was to make a descent on the coast of Dalmatia. The Peace of Villafranca made this impossible.[PARAGRAPH:2]From 
then on, Kossuth remained in Italy. He refused to follow the other Hungarian patriots, who, under the 
lead of De&#225;k, negotiated the 1867 Compromise (Ausgleich), and the ensuing amnesty. It is doubted 
whether Emperor Franz Joseph would have allowed the amnesty to extend to Kossuth. Publicly, Kossuth remained 
unreconciled to the house of Habsburg, and committed to a fully independent state. Though elected to 
the Diet of 1867, he never took his seat. He continued to remain a widely popular figure, but did not 
allow his name to be associated with dissent or any political cause. A law of 1879, which deprived of 
citizenship all Hungarians who had voluntarily been absent ten years, was a bitter blow to him. He displayed 
no interest in benefitting from a further amnesty in 1880.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1890, a delegation of hungarian 
pilgrims in Turin recorded a short patriotic speech delivered by the elderly Lajos Kossuth. The original 
recording on two wax cylinders for the Edison phonograph survives to this day, although barely audible 
due to excess playback and unsuccessful early restoration attempts. Lajos Kossuth is the earliest born 
person in the world who has his voice preserved.[PARAGRAPH:2]He died in Turin on the 20th of March 1894; 
his body was taken to Budapest, where he was buried amid the mourning of the whole nation, M&#243;r J&#243;kai 
delivering the funeral oration. A bronze statue was erected, by public subscription, in the Kerepesi 
Cemetery. Many regard Kossuth as Hungary's purest patriot and greatest orator.</Spanish>

February 23, 1443 - April 6, 1490[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Matthias 
Corvinus was born in Klausenburg, Transylvania, and was the second son of John Hunyadi. After the death 
of Mathias's father, there was a struggle between Hungary's various barons and its Habsburg King.  The 
gentry and the people of Pest finally came out in support of Matthias as king, while most barons also 
agreed to support him. [PARAGRAPH: 1] On January 20, 1458, Matthias was elected king by the Diet.  At 
this time, he was the hostage of the king of Bohemia who released under the condition of marrying his 
daughter.  Matthias was finally crowned after several wars with Bohemia and the new Emperor Frederick 
III gave him the Holy Crown.  Only the age of 15, Matthias began his reign by building public health, 
education, and a new legal system.  Matthias was also a fan of art and culture, as many artists were 
present in his court. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Matthias gained independence by dividing the barons and raising 
a large royal army.  At this time, Hungary reached its greatest territorial extent of the era.  Matthias 
was victorious in several campaigns against the Ottoman Empire by raising the Kingdom of Hungary to be 
a world power.  After that, Matthias was intent in conquering large parts of the Holy Roman Empire.  
By the end of his reign, he was in control of places such as Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia, half of Austria, 
and Vienna. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Although Vlad III Dracula, Prince of Wallachia, had many successes against 
the Ottoman Empire, Matthias imprisoned him after a disagreement between the two rulers.  Hungary decided 
to help Dracula in his fight of the threatening Ottomans, but he was assassinated.  This was a major 
blow to the position of Hungary.  In 1467, a conflict arose between Matthias and the Moldavian Prince 
Stephen III, after he became worn out by Hungary's policies and their presence at Kilia.  A revenge lead 
by Stephen leads to the defeat of Matthias at the Battle of Baia.  Matthias died in 1490 in Vienna, Austria, 
and his empire collapsed after his death because of the fact that his son was not accepted as king.</English>
