		<English>[TAB]The Cherokee (ah-ni-yv-wi-ya in Cherokee) are a people native to North America who at the time of European contact in the 16th century inhabited what is now the eastern and southeastern United States before most were forcefully moved to the Ozark Plateau. They were one of the tribes referred to as the Five Civilized Tribes.[PARAGRAPH:1]Beginning at about the time of the American Revolutionary War (late 1700s), divisions over continued accommodation of encroachments by white settlers, despite repeated violations of previous treaties, caused some Cherokee to begin to leave the Cherokee Nation. These early dissidents would eventually move across the Mississippi River to areas that would later become the states of Arkansas and Missouri. Their settlements were established on the St. Francis and the White Rivers by 1800. Eventually, there were such large numbers of Cherokees in these areas the US Government established a Cherokee Reservation located in Arkansas, with boundaries from north of the Arkansas River up to the southern bank of the White River. Many of these dissidents became known as the Chickamauga. Led by Chief Dragging Canoe, the Chickamauga made alliances with the Shawnee and engaged in raids against colonial settlements. Other Cherokee leaders who lived in Arkansas were The Bowl, Sequoyah, Spring Frog and The Dutch.[PARAGRAPH:1]Once the Cherokees reached Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), tensions ran high and the suspension of the Cherokee Blood Law was ignored. On June 22, 1839, after the adjournment of a tribal meeting, some of the prominent signers of the Treaty of New Echota were assassinated, including the drafter of the Blood Law, Major Ridge, along with John Ridge and Elias Boudinot. This started 15 years of civil war amongst the Cherokees. One of the notable survivors was Stand Watie, who became a Confederate general during the American Civil War. The Cherokees were one of the five "civilized tribes" that concluded treaties with, and were recognized by, the Confederate States of America.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1848 a group of Cherokee set out on an expedition to California looking for new settlement lands. The expedition followed the Arkansas River upstream to Rocky Mountains in present-day Colorado, then followed the base of mountains northward into present-day Wyoming before turning westward. The route become known as the Cherokee Trail. The group, which undertook gold prospecting in California, returned along the same route the following year, noticing placer gold deposits in tributaries of the South Platte. The discovery went unnoticed for a decade, but eventually became one of the primary sources of the Colorado Gold Rush of 1859.[PARAGRAPH:1]Other Cherokees in western North Carolina served as part of Thomas' Legion, a unit of approximately 1,100 men of both Cherokee and white origin, fighting primarily in Virginia, where their battle record was outstanding. Thomas' Legion was the last Confederate unit to surrender in North Carolina, at Waynesville, North Carolina on May 9, 1865.</English>

		<English>[H1]Ostenaco[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Leader of the Cherokee[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Campaign Dates: 1754-1758 [\BOLD][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]During the French and Indian War Ostenaco was a leader of Cherokee warriors who assisted Virginia military leaders against northern tribes allied to the French. His leadership provided a much-needed Indian alliance for the British colonial settlements in much of present day West Virginia and beyond. Ostenaco led the fight against Ohio Valley Indians who were allied with the French and attacking settlements in the areas of the Tygart Valley, Greenbrier River, and North and South Branches of the Potomac River. With Major Andrew Lewis he led an expedition against the Shawnee along the Big Sandy River area that ended in failure but forged a lasting friendship with Lewis. His allegiance with such Virginia leaders contributed significantly to the expansion of English-speaking peoples into what is now West Virginia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ostenaco was famous in Cherokee society for his military achievement as well as his diplomacy. His war title was Outacite or Man-Killer. During the French and Indian War (1754 - 1763), fought for control of North American trade and land, the Cherokee allied themselves with the British against the French and their Northern Indian allies. However conflict between the Cherokee and British followed with the siege on Fort Loudoun in East Tennessee. Ostenaco, the great orator, eventually made peace with a representative of colonial Virginia, Henry Timberlake, who visited for several months. Timberlake then took him and two other chiefs to visit London and King George III.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1754, the first shots in the bloody 7 year brawl known today as the French and Indian War were fired. The war embroiled several North American nations in a struggle for control of the eastern third of the continent. In the summer of 1755, English General Edward Braddock alienated Ohio Valley Iroquois, Delaware, and Shawnee allies and reaped a just reward by losing soundly to a numerically inferior army of Indians and Frenchmen near the forks of Ohio River.[PARAGRAPH:1]This loss unleashed the fury of French and Amerindian warriors against the English colonists in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. The colonies requested assistance from southern Amerindians, traditional enemies of the northerners, and the response from the Cherokees was swift and strong. Mankiller Ostenaco led 130 warriors against the Shawnees in the winter of 1756. The Cherokee campaign failed by the addition of a slow-moving, hunger-ridden, infighting Virginian army. However, a strong friendship between Mankiller Ostenaco and Mjr. Andrew Lewis ensured the steady support the colonies needed from the Cherokees.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ostenaco recruited warriors, led war parties, and conducted diplomatic missions. His efforts ensured that the colonies defensive war was complemented by effective offensive maneuvers carried to the very gates of the enemy's Ohio Valley strongholds. The Cherokee offensive campaign paved the way for the Reverand Post's peace mission to the Ohio Valley Indians, and this led to the relatively unopposed march of General Forbes army to the ruins of Fort Duquesne (present-day Pittsburgh) late in 1758.</English>
