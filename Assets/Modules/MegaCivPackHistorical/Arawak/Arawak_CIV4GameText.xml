		<English>[H1]Agueybana[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Cacique of the Arawaks[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]The 
name "Agueybana," literally meaning "Great Sun" in the Taino language, refers to two brothers, both natives 
of the island today known as Puerto Rico. Agueybana I, born between 1460 and 1480, was leader of the 
Taino, a branch of the Arawaks. In 1508, the first Spanish explorers arrived to colonize the island. 
Agueybana and the Europeans soon negotiated a mutually beneficial agreement. In return for protection 
from the other tribes of the region, Agueybana's tribe would labor for the Spaniards, mining the island's 
rich gold resources. [PARAGRAPH:1]The equitable terms of the deal would not last for long. The lust for 
gold drove the Spaniards to require more and more from their volunteer labor force and before long, it 
became apparent that Agueybana had negotiated his people into slavery. Unfortunately, he was unable to 
rectify his error. Whether through overwork, old age or illness (European disease had begun to ravage 
the island), Agueybana passed away in 1510. [PARAGRAPH:1]Over the following year, Agueybana's brother 
took up the mantle of leadership, as well as his brother's name, becoming Agueybana II. Through covert 
planning, Agueybana II organized a rebellion against the island's governor, Juan Ponce de Leon (the conquistador 
known for his misguided foray in search of the Fountain of Youth). With the element of surprise on their 
side, Agueybana's warriors were initially successful, yet their victory would be fleeting. Between the 
rapidly increasing numbers of Spaniards arriving on the island and the storm of new diseases battering 
the Arawak population, the natives of Puerto Rico were nearly obliterated over the next thirty years. 
Agueybana II himself died in the rebellion he worked to foment, passing away in 1511.</English>

		<English>[H1]Cacique[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Chief of a Arawak Tribe[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1400ish 
- 1510[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]is a title derived from the Taíno for 
the pre-Colombian chiefs or leaders of tribes in the Bahamas, Greater Antilles, and the northern Lesser 
Antilles. Subsequent to encounters with the Taíno upon their arrival in the New World, the Spanish used 
the word as a title for the leaders of the other indigenous tribes they encountered in the Western Hemisphere 
territories they occupied. In Spanish language, the term has come to mean a local political boss who 
exercises significant power.[PARAGRAPH:1]The term is also used in the Portuguese language to describe 
the leaders of indigenous communities in Brazil. It is also frequently used in Portugal to describe how 
certain influential and well known students use their powerful social character to influence student 
body elections in the student movement in Portugal's major universities. In Spain and in Brazil the word 
is most commonly used in the third sense, meaning "a person in a village or region who exercises excessive 
influence in political matters."[PARAGRAPH:1]Cacique comes from the Taíno word kassiquan, meaning "to 
keep house."In the Taíno culture, the cacique rank was apparently established through democratic means. 
His importance in the tribe was determined by the size of his tribe rather than his warlord skills, since 
the Taínos were mostly a pacifist culture. They also enjoyed several privileges for their standing: they 
lived in a larger rectangular hut in the center of the village and had a special sitting place for the 
areytos (ceremonial dances) and the ceremonial ball game.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Arawaks were one of the most prominent societies of the Caribbean at the time of 
the New World's discovery and were the first natives encountered by Columbus. Originating in South America 
(where there remain a few scattered settlements of Arawak to this day), the Arawaks migrated to the Caribbean 
islands, where they established settlements from the Lesser Antilles to Cuba. They are thought to have 
arrived in the Caribbean around 500 BC, but in large part were obliterated from the Lesser Antilles by 
their sworn foes the Carib, who also hailed from northern South America and for whom the Caribbean Sea 
was named. [PARAGRAPH:2]The Arawak migration across the vast Caribbean was possible thanks in large part 
to their expert abilities as navigators. Arawak boat-builders were capable of creating massive canoes, 
the largest of which could carry roughly 150 souls. These served the Arawaks well in their primary activity 
- trade. Arawak canoes could often be found cruising between islands, heavy with trade goods, including 
gold, wood carvings, trained parrots and other luxuries, along with basic food stuffs, pottery, or fishing 
nets. [PARAGRAPH:2]Our earliest records of Arawak society come from Columbus himself. Upon setting down 
at Hispanola, Columbus was impressed by the gentle nature of the Arawaks, who seemed more awed than threatened 
by his sailors. When Columbus' ship, the Santa Maria, ran aground of the coast of the island, a cacique 
(Arawak leader) named Guacanagari sheltered Columbus and his men, giving them gifts of gold and other 
fineries. [PARAGRAPH:2]The ease of Arawak life would not long survive the arrival of the Europeans: in 
fact, a convergence of events nearly wiped them from the Caribbean. After seeing that there was gold 
to be had in this new land, the Spaniards began employing the docile natives as slave labor. At the same 
time, the Carib began a renewed effort to remove the Arawaks from their homes in the southern Caribbean. 
And all the while, European diseases began to creep through the population. Between these three factors, 
the Arawak population was nearly obliterated within a decade. [PARAGRAPH:2]As the first people to meet 
westerners, the Arawaks left an indelible mark on the European conquerors. The hammock was among the 
innovations first presented to western society by the Arawaks and the space-saving resting place would 
become an important part of naval fleets until the twentieth century. As well, the cooking method known 
as barbecuing, where pieces of meat are left to simmer over low heat for hours on end, was first performed 
before western eyes by the Arawaks.</English>

		<Spanish>Arahuaco o arawak es el nombre genérico dado a varios pueblos indígenas que se encontraban 
asentados en las Antillas y la región circuncaribe a la llegada de los españoles en el siglo XV. El nombre 
también se ha aplicado posteriormente a numerosas etnias que hablan o hablaban lenguas de la familia 
arawak y que tradicionalmente habitaban una extensa zona comprendida entre la actual Florida y las Antillas, 
Venezuela, el oeste de Perú, el sur de Brasil e incluso Bolivia y Paraguay. De hecho esta familia de 
lenguas es una de las más extendida de América del sur. El término arahuaco no debe confundirse con arawaco 
usado para designar a grupos étnicos de Colombia de la familia chibcha, ni tampoco todos los pueblos 
cuya lengua es considerada arawacana son de hecho arahuacos.Incluían a los taínos, que ocupaban las Antillas 
Mayores y Bahamas, los nepoyas y suppoyos de Trinidad y los iñeris que habitaban las Antillas Menores 
antes de la llegada de los caribe, que vivían en la costa este de América del Sur, hasta lo que es actualmente 
Brasil. El extremo sur de la difusión arahuaca se encontró en territorios del extremo norte de Argentina 
a donde antes del siglo XIV había llegado la parcialidad arahuaca conocida como chané, en el siglo XX 
todavía había grupos arawak en el NE. de Boliva y E. de Paraguay.</Spanish>
