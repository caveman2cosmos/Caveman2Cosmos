		<English>[TAB]More stable living patterns gave rise by around 14,000 BCE to a Mesolithic or, as some 
scholars argue, Neolithic culture, but with some characteristics of both. Possibly distant ancestors 
of the Ainu aboriginal people of modern Japan, members of the heterogeneous Jomon culture (c. 14,000-300 
BCE) left the clearest archaeological record. They were related to the nearby Jeulmun culture of Korea.[PARAGRAPH:2]The 
Jomon era pottery was called Jomon doki. Jomon means patterns of rope, and most earthware resembled designs 
made by rope. First they wet the soil and made a rope out of it (wring it into a rope). Then they gave 
it the desired shape with their hands. Mostly they ate or stored their food in the pots they made.The 
Jomon people were also making clay figures and vessels decorated with patterns of a growing sophistication 
made by impressing the wet clay with braided or unbraided cord and sticks.[PARAGRAPH:2]The manufacturing 
of pottery typically implies some form of sedentary life due to the fact that pottery is highly breakable 
and thus generally useless to hunter-gatherers who are constantly on the move. Therefore, the Jomon people 
were probably some of the earliest sedentary or at least semi-sedentary people in the world. They used 
chipped stone tools, ground stone tools, traps, and bows, and were probably semi-sedentary hunters-gatherers 
and skillful coastal and deep-water fishermen. They practiced a rudimentary form of agriculture and lived 
in caves and later in groups of either shallow pit dwellings or above-ground houses, leaving rich middens 
for modern archaeological study. Because of this, the earliest forms of farming are sometimes attributed 
to Japan (Ingpen and Wilkinson) in 10,000 BCE, two thousand years before their widespread appearance 
in the Middle East. However, some archaeological evidence also suggests early experiments with agriculture 
in the hills and valleys of the Fertile Crescent in modern Syria, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq around 11,000 
BCE.[PARAGRAPH:2]This semi-sedentary culture led to important population increases, so that the Jomon 
exhibit some of the highest densities known for foraging populations. Genetic mapping studies by Cavalli-Sforza 
have shown a pattern of genetic expansion from the area of the Sea of Japan towards the rest of eastern 
Asia. This appears as the third most important genetic movement in Eastern Asia (after the "Great expansion" 
from the African continent, and a second expansion from the area of Northern Siberia), which suggests 
geographical expansion during the early Jomon period. These studies also suggest that the Jomon demographic 
expansion may have reached America along a path following the Pacific coast.</English>
