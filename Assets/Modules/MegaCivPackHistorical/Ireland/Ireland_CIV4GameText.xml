		<English>[TAB]Ireland was mostly ice-covered and joined by land to Britain and Europe during the last 
ice age. It has been inhabited for about 9,000 years. Stone age inhabitants arrived sometime after 8000 
BC, with the culture progressing from Mesolithic to high Neolithic over the course of three or four millennia. 
The Bronze Age, which began around 2500 BC, saw the production of elaborate gold and bronze ornaments 
and weapons. The Iron Age in Ireland is associated with people now known as Celts. They are traditionally 
thought to have colonised Ireland in a series of waves between the 8th and 1st centuries BC, with the 
Gael, the last wave of Celts, conquering the island and dividing it into five or more kingdoms. Many 
scholars, however, now favour a view that emphasises cultural diffusion from overseas over significant 
colonisation.The Romans referred to Ireland as Hibernia. Ptolemy in AD 100 records Ireland's geography 
and tribes. Native accounts are confined to Irish poetry, myth, and archaeology. The exact relationship 
between Rome and the tribes of Hibernia is unclear; the only references are a few Roman writings.[PARAGRAPH:2]Tradition 
maintains that in AD 432, St. Patrick arrived on the island and, in the years that followed, worked to 
convert the Irish to Christianity. The druid tradition collapsed in the face of the spread of the new 
faith. Irish Christian scholars excelled in the study of Latin learning and Christian theology in the 
monasteries that flourished, preserving Latin learning during the Early Middle Ages. The arts of manuscript 
illumination, metalworking, and sculpture flourished and produced such treasures as the Book of Kells, 
ornate jewellery, and the many carved stone crosses that dot the island. This era was interrupted in 
the 9th century by 200 years of intermittent warfare with waves of Viking raiders who plundered monasteries 
and towns. Eventually they settled in Ireland and established many towns, including the modern day cities 
of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1172, King Henry II of England gained Irish lands 
by the granting of the 1155 Bull Laudibiliter to him by then English Pope Adrian IV, and from the 13th 
century, English law began to be introduced. English rule was largely limited to the area around Dublin, 
known as the Pale, and Waterford, but this began to expand in the 16th century with the final collapse 
of the Gaelic social and political superstructure at the end of the 17th century, as a result of the 
Tudor re-conquest of Ireland and English and Scottish Protestant colonisation in the Plantations of Ireland, 
which established English control over the whole island. After the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Irish Catholics 
were barred from voting or attending the Irish Parliament. The new English Protestant ruling class was 
known as the Protestant Ascendancy.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1800 the Irish Parliament passed the Act of Union 
which, in 1801, merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Ireland. The whole island of Ireland would remain within the United Kingdom, ruled 
directly by the UK Parliament in London. The 19th century saw the Great Famine of the 1840s in which 
at least 1 million Irish people died and over a million were forced to emigrate.[PARAGRAPH:2]The late 
19th and early 20th century saw a vigorous but unsuccessful campaign for Irish home rule, followed by 
the eclipse of moderate nationalism by militant separatism. In 1922, following the Anglo-Irish War, twenty-six 
counties of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom as the Irish Free State. The remaining six, in the 
north-east, remained within the Union as Northern Ireland. Secession for the rest of Ireland led directly 
to the Civil War, as militant nationalists split into two factions and turned against one another.[PARAGRAPH:2]The 
Anglo-Irish Treaty was narrowly ratified by the Dáil in December 1921 but was rejected by a large minority, 
resulting in the Irish Civil War which lasted until 1923. In 1922, in the middle of this civil war, the 
Irish Free State came into being. For its first years the new state was governed by the victors of the 
Civil War. However in the 1930s Fianna Fáil, the party of the opponents of the treaty, were elected into 
government. The party introduced a new constitution in 1937 which renamed the state to simply "Éire or 
in the English language, Ireland" (preface to the Constitution).[PARAGRAPH:2]The state was neutral during 
World War II but offered some assistance to the Allies. In 1949 the state declared itself to be a republic 
and that henceforth it should be described as the Republic of Ireland. The state was plagued by poverty 
and emigration until the mid-1970's. The 1990's saw the beginning of unprecedented economic success, 
in a phenomenon known as the "Celtic Tiger". By the early 2000's, it had become one of the richest countries 
(in terms of GDP per capita) in the European Union, moving from being a net recipient to a net contributor 
and from a population with net emigration to one with net immigration.</English>

- 157 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Conn Cetchathach (or Cead-Cathach) 
was the son of Fedhlimidh Rachtmar, the High King of Ireland and Ughna, daughter of the King of Lochlin 
(Denmark). Conn is also known as Conn of the 100 Battles or the 100 Treaties. His grandfather was Tuathal 
Teachtmar, the Irish High King who made Connacht the Supreme province of the five in Ireland at the time. 
[PARAGRAPH:1]Conn's name is unusual and according to legend, portions were given late in life or after 
his death. Conn Cead-Cathach means Conn (speed, virtue, champion), Cead (one hundred) and Cathach (of 
Battles). Conn also had an older meaning that is referred to as dog, or a warrior with the fighting qualities 
of a dog.[PARAGRAPH:1]Little is known of Conn's youth and he did not succeed his father in rule. Between 
Fedhlimidh and Conn ruled Cathair Mor. Cathair was defeated in a great battle by Conn in Meath. He then 
took the reigns as Ard-Righ or High King. During Conn's lifetime he certainly lived up to his name, fighting 
numerous battles most of which were against Mogh Nuadat of Munster.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Ithians and Eberians 
alternately ruled the province of Munster in an arrangement that worked peacefully until the Earnaan 
arrived. The Earnaan had been forced out of Ulster and applied for land in Munster to King Duach who 
gracefully assented. But the Earnaan did not repay their host's kindness and instead, took control of 
the province. The Eberians revolted and attempted to regain their territory. Conn, the High King, sent 
aid to the Earnaan but even with his help they lost the battle.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>

[PARAGRAPH:1]Conn's name is unusual and according to legend, portions were given late in life or after 
his death. Conn Cead-Cathach means Conn (speed, virtue, champion), Cead (one hundred) and Cathach (of 
Battles). Conn also had an older meaning that is referred to as dog, or a warrior with the fighting qualities 
of a dog.[PARAGRAPH:1]Little is known of Conn's youth and he did not succeed his father in rule. Between 
Fedhlimidh and Conn ruled Cathair Mor. Cathair was defeated in a great battle by Conn in Meath. He then 
took the reigns as Ard-Righ or High King. During Conn's lifetime he certainly lived up to his name, fighting 
numerous battles most of which were against Mogh Nuadat of Munster.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Ithians and Eberians 
alternately ruled the province of Munster in an arrangement that worked peacefully until the Earnaan 
arrived. The Earnaan had been forced out of Ulster and applied for land in Munster to King Duach who 
gracefully assented. But the Earnaan did not repay their host's kindness and instead, took control of 
the province. The Eberians revolted and attempted to regain their territory. Conn, the High King, sent 
aid to the Earnaan but even with his help they lost the battle.[PARAGRAPH:1]</French>

[\BOLD] 1890 - 1922 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Michael John ("Mick") 
Collins was an Irish revolutionary leader, Minister for Finance in the First DÃƒÂ¡il of 1919, Director 
of Intelligence for the IRA, and member of the Irish delegation during the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations, 
both as Chairman of the Provisional Government and Commander-in-Chief of the National Army. In April 
1922, a group of 200 anti-Treaty IRA men occupied the Four Courts in Dublin in defiance of the Provisional 
government. Collins, who wanted to avoid civil war at all costs, did not attack them until June 1922, 
needing to know the result of the general election which proved favourable to his party. British pressure 
also forced his hand. On 22 June 1922, Sir Henry Wilson, a retired British Army field marshal now serving 
as Military Advisor to the Craig Administration, was shot dead by two IRA men in Belgravia, London. At 
the time, it was presumed that the anti-Treaty faction of the IRA were responsible and Winston Churchill 
told Collins that unless he moved against the Four Courts garrison, he (Churchill) would use British 
troops to do so.[PARAGRAPH:1]In fact, it has since been proved that Collins himself ordered the killing 
of Wilson in reprisal for failing to prevent the attacks on Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland. Joe 
Dolan - a member of Collins' "Squad" or assassination unit in the War of Independence and in 1922 a captain 
in the National Army - revealed this in the 1950s, along with the revelation that Collins had ordered 
him to try to rescue the two gunmen before they were executed. In any event, this forced Collins to take 
action against the Four Courts men and the final provocation came when they kidnapped J.J. O'Connell, 
a provisional government general. After a final attempt to persuade the men to leave, Collins borrowed 
two 18 pounder artillery pieces from the British and bombarded the Four Courts until its garrison surrendered.[PARAGRAPH:1]He 
was shot and killed in August 1922, during the Irish Civil War. Although most Irish political parties 
recognise his contribution to the foundation of the modern Irish state, members and supporters of the 
Fine Gael political party hold his memory in particular esteem, regarding him as their movement's founding 
father (even though his link to them was through their precursor Cumann na nGaedhael, a name adopted 
in 1923 by the pro-Treaty wing of Sinn Fein).</English>
