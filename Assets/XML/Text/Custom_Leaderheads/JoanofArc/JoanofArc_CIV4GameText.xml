		<English>[H1]Joan of Arc[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Commander of the French Army[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1412 - 1431[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Joan of Arc, or Jeanne d'Arc in French, was a 15th century saint and national heroine of France. She was the only person ever recorded to have commanded the entire army of a nation at the age of seventeen; she was captured by the English and tried by an ecclesiastical court led by Bishop Pierre Cauchon, an English partisan, the court convicted her of heresy and she was burned at the stake by the English when she was nineteen years old. Twenty-four years later, the Vatican reviewed the decision of the ecclesiastical court, found her innocent, and declared her a martyr. She was beatified in 1909 and canonized as a saint in 1920.[PARAGRAPH:1]Joan asserted that she had visions from God that told her to recover her homeland from English domination late in the Hundred Years' War. The uncrowned King Charles VII sent her to the siege at Orléans as part of a relief mission. She gained prominence when she overcame the dismissive attitude of veteran commanders and lifted the siege in only nine days. Several more swift victories led to Charles VII's coronation at Reims and settled the disputed succession to the throne.[PARAGRAPH:1]The renewed French confidence outlasted her own brief career. She refused to leave the field when she was wounded during an attempt to recapture Paris that autumn. She defied the cautious strategy that had characterized French leadership. During the five months of siege before her arrival, the defenders of Orléans had attempted only one aggressive move and that had ended in disaster. On 4 May the French attacked and captured the outlying fortress of Saint Loup, which she followed on 5 May with a march to a second fortress called Saint Jean le Blanc. Finding it deserted, this became a bloodless victory. The next day she opposed Jean d'Orleans at a war council where she demanded another assault on the enemy. D'Orleans ordered the city gates locked to prevent another battle, but she summoned the townsmen and common soldiers and forced the mayor to unlock a gate. With the aid of only one captain she rode out and captured the fortress of Saint Augustins. That evening she learned she had been excluded from a war council where the leaders had decided to wait for reinforcements before acting again. Disregarding this decision, she insisted on assaulting the main English stronghold called "les Tourelles" on 7 May. Contemporaries acknowledged her as the heroine of the engagement after she sustained an arrow wound to her neck but returned wounded to lead the final charge.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hampered by court intrigues, she led only minor companies from then onward and fell prisoner at a skirmish near Compiègne the following spring. oan's trial for heresy was politically motivated. The Duke of Bedford claimed the throne of France for his nephew Henry VI. She had been responsible for the rival coronation so to condemn her was to undermine her king's legitimacy. Legal proceedings commenced on 9 January 1431 at Rouen, the seat of the English occupation government. The procedure was irregular on a number of points. In 1456, Pope Callixtus III declared her innocent of the heresy charges brought against her. The trial record demonstrates her remarkable intellect. The transcript's most famous exchange is an exercise in subtlety. "Asked if she knew she was in God's grace, she answered: 'If I am not, may God put me there; and if I am, may God so keep me.'" The question is a scholarly trap. Church doctrine held that no one could be certain of being in God's grace. If she had answered yes, then she would have convicted herself of heresy. If she had answered no, then she would have confessed her own guilt. Notary Boisguillaume would later testify that at the moment the court heard this reply, "Those who were interrogating her were stupefied."[PARAGRAPH:1]The English regent John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford had her burnt at the stake in Rouen. She had been the heroine of her country at 17 and died when only 19 years old. Some 24 years later, Pope Callixtus III reopened the case, and a new finding overturned the original conviction. Her piety to the end impressed the retrial court. Pope Benedict XV canonized her on May 16, 1920.[PARAGRAPH:1]Joan has been a political symbol in France since the time of Napoleon. Liberals emphasized her humble origins. Early conservatives stressed her support of the monarchy. Later conservatives recalled her nationalism. During World War II, both the Vichy Regime and the French Resistance used her image: Vichy propaganda remembered her campaign against the English with posters that showed British warplanes bombing Rouen and the ominous caption: "They Always Return to the Scene of Their Crimes." The resistance emphasized her fight against foreign occupation and her origins in the province of Lorraine, which had fallen under Nazi control. Traditional Catholics, especially in France, also use her as a symbol of inspiration, often comparing the 1988 excommunication of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre (founder of the Society of St. Pius X and a dissident against the Vatican II reforms) to Joan's excommunication. Three separate vessels of the French Navy have been named after her, including a helicopter carrier currently in active service. At present the controversial French far-right political party Front National holds rallies at her statues, reproduces her likeness in party publications, and uses a tricolor flame partly symbolic of her martyrdom as its emblem. This party's opponents sometimes satirize its appropriation of her image. The French civic holiday in her honor is the second Sunday of May.</English>

Podczas wojny stuletniej poprowadziła armię francuską do kilku ważnych zwycięstw, twierdząc, że działa kierowana przez Boga. Pośrednio przyczyniła się do koronacji Karola VII. Została schwytana przez Burgundczyków i przekazana Anglikom, osądzona przez sąd kościelny i spalona na stosie w wieku 19 lat. 24 lata później papież Kalikst III dokonał rewizji decyzji sądu kościelnego. Uniewinnił ją i określił przeprowadzony w Rouen proces jako sprzeczny z prawem. Została beatyfikowana w 1909 roku i kanonizowana w 1920. Joanna twierdziła, że otrzymała widzenie od Boga, podczas którego dostała polecenie wyzwolenia ojczyzny spod panowania angielskiego. Chcąc wypróbować jej prawdomówność, niekoronowany król Karol VII wysłał ją do oblężonego Orleanu. Po doprowadzeniu do zniesienia oblężenia miasta w ciągu zaledwie dziewięciu dni uzyskała powszechny szacunek i przezwyciężyła lekceważącą postawę weteranów. Kilka kolejnych zwycięstw doprowadziło do koronacji Karola VII w Reims i rozstrzygnęło spór o sukcesję tronu Francji.</Polish>
