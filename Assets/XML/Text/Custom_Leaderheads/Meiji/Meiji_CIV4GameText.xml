		<English>[H1]Emperor Meiji[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of Japan[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] November 3, 1852 - July 30, 1912[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Born just eight months before Commodore Matthew Perry and the United States squadron of "Black Ships" came to demand the opening of Japan to foreign trade, Prince Mutsuhito, the 122nd emperor in the traditional count, marked the beginning of a national revolution known as the Meiji Restoration when he ascended to the throne.[PARAGRAPH:1]Once he had taken on the title of Emperor on 3 February 1867, Mutsuhito took the name Meiji (meaning "enlightened government"), and a group of radical nationalists united under his power to take on the Tokugawa shogunate and bring rise to a new era. Only shortly after his ascent to the throne Meiji married Lady Haruko who then became known as Empress Shoken, she was the first woman from the Imperial consort to be given the title kogo or emperor's wife. Shoken, however, bore him no children. Meiji did have children though, fifteen to be exact and to five different ladies in waiting.[PARAGRAPH:1]Though many think of the Meiji Restoration as "bloodless", there was in fact a great civil war fought within Japan shortly after his ascension to the throne. Imperial forces gathered under Meiji's rule and defeated the Tokugawa in the Boshin War of 1868-1869. It was at this time that Meiji moved the capital from Kyoto to Edo, which was then renamed Tokyo, and the Meiji period began in earnest. Though Meiji remained Emperor, the government had now become an oligarchy composed of the greatest military, political, and economic men of Japan.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the Meiji Restoration in progress, the Japanese had sent delegations and students around the world in order to learn and assimilate western arts and sciences; this was done not only to prevent Japan from falling under foreign domination but to enable Japan to compete equally with the Western powers. Sweeping changes were occuring... although many powerful men from the Satsuma domain in northern Japan had risen to influential positions in the new Meiji government, there was growing dissatisfaction with the direction the country was taking. The modernization (westernization) of the country meant the abolition of the privileged social status of the samurai class and had undermined their financial position. The very rapid and massive changes to Japanese culture, dress, and society appeared to many samurai to be a betrayal of the joi ("expel the barbarian") portion of the Sonno joi justification used to overthrow the former Tokugawa shogunate in the Boshin War. This led to the Satsuma Rebellion, which was a revolt of samurai against the Meiji government from January 29, 1877 to September 24,1877, eleven years into the Meiji Era. It was the last, and the most serious, of a series of armed uprisings against the new government. In a tough series of battles, the samurai were finally defeated. Financially, crushing the Satsuma Rebellion cost the government greatly, forcing Japan off of the gold standard and causing the government to print paper currency. The rebellion was also effectively the end of the samurai class, as the new Imperial Japanese Army built of conscripts without regard to social class had proven itself in battle. Saigo Takamori was labeled as a tragic hero by the people and on February 22, 1889 Emperor Meiji pardoned Saigo posthumously.[PARAGRAPH:1]After securing internal peace, Japan began to reach outward towards imperial ambitions as a great power equal to western nations. The First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) was a war fought between Qing Dynasty China and Meiji Japan over the control of Korea which Japan won. The war demonstrated the superiority of Japanese tactics and training as a result of the adoption of a western style military, though it raised tensions between Japan and Russia, which in turn led to the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) and grew out of the rival imperialist ambitions of the Russian Empire and Japanese Empire over Manchuria and Korea. In the end, Japan sunk two of Russia's three fleets and defeated Russia in Manchuria, securing victory for Japan.[PARAGRAPH:1]Meiji himself was mainly a figure of leadership that helped the imperialists defeat the Tokugawa shogunate and restore peace to the people. His rule wasn't long, but he played enough part to help establish the Meiji era. It was the restoration that established Japan as a top power in the Pacific and helped it to maintain an important international presence. Little is known about Meiji himself including whether or not he wanted war or peace, or how much power he actually had during the revolution. It is said that the Emperor was more a symbol of unity to the people while it was his ministers that did the actual ruling. Though he may not of done much physically or verbally, his very presence did a lot. Emperor Meiji died in 1912 and was buried in the Graveyard (Fushimi Momoyama Ryo) in Kyoto. After his death, the end of the Meiji era left the people of Japan nervous and unsure of what the future might bring.[PARAGRAPH:1]Meiji symbolized the unity of the people under one government rising up to strike down the Tokugawa shogunate in order to establish a safer and more peaceful future. During his reign, Japan became an industrial power able to compete with the nations of the West. The Meiji shrine in the center of Tokyo was built in his honor.</English>

Zdjęcie zrobione przez Uchida Kuichi w 1873. W 1872 r. przeprowadzono reformy zmierzające do zmniejszenia obciążeń chłopów oraz poprawy ich sytuacji materialnej i społecznej. Rok później przystąpiono do realizacji planu wprowadzenia powszechnego szkolnictwa i utworzenia armii opartej na powszechnym poborze. Jednocześnie dokonano zasadniczych zmian w strukturze klasowej społeczeństwa, znosząc wiele przywilejów warstwy samurajskiej i ograniczeń dotykających inne grupy społeczne. Zmiany te spotkały się z oporem części społeczeństwa. Jednak lokalne bunty zostały szybko stłumione. Przeprowadzono także zasadnicze zmiany ustroju państwa, które doprowadziły ostatecznie do wprowadzenia w Japonii monarchii konstytucyjnej.</Polish>
