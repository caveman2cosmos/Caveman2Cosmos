		<English>This order will have the Spy or Criminal infiltrate a foreign city to bring home useful information (Espionage Points) about the rival. Spies use Espionage Points and are consumed.  Criminals must pass an investigation check to be successful.  If they are, they are sent back to the capital.  Otherwise they become wanted and lose the rest of their movement for that turn.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_MISSION_CONDUCT_TRADE_MISSION_HELP</Tag>
		<English>Conduct a trade mission in this city. The amount of gold created is relative to the size of the city and distance to the city the unit was trained or born in, as well as if the city is foreign. It consumes a Great Person, but sends regular merchants and criminals back to the capital.  Criminals, attempting to trade their contraband, may fail an investigation check for this mission and thus fail to derive the gold, lose their movement for the turn and become 'Wanted'.</English>
