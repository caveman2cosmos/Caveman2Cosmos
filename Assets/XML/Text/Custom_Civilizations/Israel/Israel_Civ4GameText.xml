		<English>Israel is a small nation in the Middle East, located in Southwest Asia on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea. The State of Israel was established in 1948 as a refuge for Jews worldwide. The founders of the modern state of Israel sought to create a new country whose principles, customs, and way of life would be Jewish.[PARAGRAPH:1]Jewish kingdoms flourished in the region in ancient times, but before 1948, there had been no Jewish state for 2,000 years. The Jews were scattered all over the world after the Romans had driven them out in the first and second centuries AD. Despite all this oppression, the Jews never forgot the Land of Israel. The Jews are closely connected with the Land of Israel because of all of the religious events that occurred in Israel. There were also very important events in history in Israel, such as the destruction of the temple and the rise and fall of Jewish kingdoms. When Jews were persecuted in the Middle Ages, it was the hope of returning to Israel that kept them alive.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Exodus out of Egypt, lead by Moses, lead the Hebrews to the ancient Land of Israel. The Philistines forced the Hebrews to unite under a single leader, Saul, who lead the Hebrews to victory over the Philistines. Saul is usually regarded as the first Hebrew king. Saul was followed by King David. David was a hero from childhood, when he had slain the lion-beast Goliath. David declared Jerusalem the capital, and created a powerful military. David also brought the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, which contained two stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written. Solomon followed David. Solomon was a master diplomat, who built roads, fortresses, and a royal palace. Most famous is Solomon's temple, known as the Temple of Solomon. The Temple of Solomon was the center of Jewish religion in that time[PARAGRAPH:1]High taxes in Israel lead to the division of the kingdom. The north, Israel, carried most of the population and territory. The small and southern portion became Judah. Israel survived for two centuries. It was destroyed internally, and was caught by rival empires. At 734 BC, the Assyrians invaded Israel. They killed many Israelites and exiled many more. Judah, had less violence than Israel. In 586 BC, Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians and the Temple of Solomon was destroyed. But the Judeans refused to forget there homeland of Judah. The Judeans came together in gatherings that were the forerunner for synogogues. They listened to their prophets. When Cyrus the Great of Persia took control of Palestinian lands, he allowed the Judeans to return to there land. For 600 years, there was another Jewish state.[PARAGRAPH:1]When the Judeans returned to Israel, the process of creating a new kingdom proved to be hard. There were religious troubles in Israel. Non-Jews were scorned in Judean society. New prophets had to teach that God was not only meant for the Jews, but all people. In the fourth century BC, Alexander the Great defeated the country. This brought in pagan customs to the land. Some youths even abandoned Jewish traditions. A later Greek ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, persecuted the Jews and their traditions. Under Judah Maccabee and his brothers, a revolt flared. In 165, the Jewish state was independent once again.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the first century BC, Rome conquered the Jewish State. Rome's rule was tyrannical, and a Jewish revolt began in 66 AD. The Roman legions conquered Jerusalem after a long resistance in 70 AD. The Romans destroyed the temple, and all that remained was the wall. This wall became known as the Wailing Wall, and is the holiest place for prayer for the Jews today. In 73 AD, the Romans conquered Masada, and the Jewish state was destroyed. The Jewish people were in exile. For many years, the Jews faced horrible punishment for being Jews during the Middle Ages.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the 19th Century, waves of anti-Semitism spread across Eastern Europe, where many Jews lived. Many Jews emigrated to the United States and Europe. Some moved to Palestine, the location of the ancient Land of Israel. This idea of creating a new Jewish state is called Zionism. The Holocaust of World War II, when six million Jews were murdered, added to the intensity of the Zionist movement. The war also left many Jewish refugees in Europe. Many preferred to establish a new nation rather than move to new homes, or go back to their old country.[PARAGRAPH:1]The United Nations noticed the need for a Jewish homeland, and in 1947, it recommended that Palestine be turned into a Jewish state. On May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, declared Israel's independence. Many Arab countries opposed this decision, and this sparked the years of Arab-Israeli conflict that would come. Israel since has developed into a modern democracy, and is one of the most powerful countries in the Middle East.</English>

		<English>[H1]David Ben Gurion[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Israel[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1886 - 1973[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]David Ben Gurion was born David Gryn on October 16, 1886 in Plonsk, Poland. His father, Avgdor Gryn, was a Zionist who inspired David that there will be someday a homeland for the Jewish people. David Ben Gurion was at the front position of the Labor Zionist movement during the fifteen years preceding the creation of Israel. He was a strict, frugal optimist who was characterized by his commitment to the creation of a Jewish state. He stressed that Israel would "uphold the full social and political equality of all its citizens, without distinction of race, creed, or sex. "[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1910, Ben Gurion became an editor for the Palestine Labor Party's magazine. He signed articles as "Ben Gurion" meaning "son of young lion. " From this moment on, he was known as David Ben Gurion. When World War I broke out in 1914, Ben Gurion was arrested by the Turks and expelled from Palestine. He fled to Egypt, then the United States. In America, he encouraged the youth to emigrate to Palestine. In 1917, Ben Gurion organized the Jewish Legion to fight with Britain against the Turks. In 1918, he returned to Palestine.[PARAGRAPH:1]For the next 20 years, Ben Gurion devoted his life to Zionism. He helped organize the Histadrut, which was the General Federation of Jewish Labor. In 1935 he became chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine. This organization helped Jewish immigrants settle in Palestine.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ben Gurion was also involved in a violent resistance when his organization cooperated with Menachem Begin's Irgun. Ben Gurion agreed to carry out Begin's plan which was to bomb the King David Hotel in a hope to embarrass the British military. However, when the results of mass killing became obvious, he immediately called the operation off. However, Begin refused. In September of 1947 Ben Gurion reached a comfortable agreement with the Orthodox Agudath Israel party. He sent a letter to the party promising that Shabbat would be Israel's national day of rest, there would be no civil marriages, and the Orthodox sector would be given independence in the category of religious education.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ben Gurion declared Israel's independence on May 14, 1948. During the first weeks of the independence, he ordered all the militias to be replaced by a national army, the IDF, or the Israel Defense Forces. In 1968, when Rafi merged with Mapai to form the Alignment, Ben Gurion refused to follow his party. Instead, he created a new party, the National List, which won four seats in the 1969 election. Ben Gurion retired from politics in 1970, and spent the last years living on a kibbutz. Ben Gurion is buried next to his wife Paula in Sdeh Boker.</English>

		<English>[H1]David[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Israel[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 1005 - 970 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]David was the king of Judah and Israel. He is described in the Bible in the books of Samuel and Kings. David was the son of a landowner, Jesse, of the tribe of Judah. He had eight brothers, of which David was the youngest. He tended his father's sheep, whiling away many hours by playing the harp. David lived about 1000 BC, when the Philistines pressed dangerously on the newly established Kingdom of Israel. Israel's first king, Saul, had to fight almost constantly against the Philistines. It is said that one of these battles, David killed Goliath, champion of the Philistines. King Saul then appointed David as his armor bearer.[PARAGRAPH:1]The king's daughter fell in love with David, and they were married. David became a popular hero, and because of this, the Judeans made him king of their tribe. After King Saul and his son died in battle, David became king of Israel. David's main goal was to unite the tribes of Israel into one kingdom. There were many wars against the surrounding nations, and David proved to be a very good military leader.[PARAGRAPH:1]To bind the tribes closer together, David established on capital. David conquered Jerusalem, to which he brought the ark of the law. The ark contained two stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written. King David was not only known for his military might, but his religious closeness to God. David suffered many disappointments, but through it all, he remained a powerful leader.[PARAGRAPH:1]King David wrote many religious poems, or psalms, that are today included in many synogogues and churches. David helped arrange services that would later be used in the temple build by his son, Solomon. King David was so loved and admired, that some thought of him as the messiah.</English>

David's military skill relieved Israel of its constant war threats from surrounding nations, and Solomon's diplomatic skill maintained this empire without the need for further war. Solomon was productive in art and science. He wrote the Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, and most of the Book of Proverbs, three books found in the Bible. Early in Solomon's reign, God promised him great wisdom.[PARAGRAPH:1]When King David was aging, he lost his mental sharpness. His oldest son, Adonijah, attempted to seize the throne from Solomon. Despite the fact that God had promised Solomon the throne, David, in his declining mental health, did nothing to stop Adonijah and his preparations. Eventually, the case was brought to the attention of David by Solomon's supporters. David immediately made Solomon king, and retired. Normally, Solomon would kill Adonijah. However, in an attempt to spare his life, Adonijah stole the altar of God and refused to give it back until Solomon promised to spare his life.[PARAGRAPH:1]Solomon is described as surrounding himself with luxuries because of the government's success. Solomon established an alliance with Hiram I, king of Tyre, who helped to give Solomon the supplies he needed for the construction of the Temple. Hiram, and an architect also named Hiram, also helped Solomon complete the construction of the Ark of the Covenant.[PARAGRAPH:1]Solomon built many houses, palaces, gardens, parks, irrigations, and public works. The most famous of his achievements is his construction of the Temple. Because David was unable to build the temple, he accumulated materials for future use. Solomon imported more supplies later. The amount was so great that, to transport the materials, Solomon conscripted a labor force of nearly 200,000 of his own people, not counting the workers of the foreign exporters. Solomon preached sermons and worshipped at the temple. He also prayed to God to be present at the temple. God spoke to Solomon again, and said that if his people were unfaithful, he would destroy them. Even so, if they confessed and repented, he would bless them again.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the completion of the temple, Solomon built many other buildings of importance in Jerusalem. For thirteen years, he was engaged in building the royal palace on Ophel. Solomon is also described to rebuild major cities elsewhere in Israel. Solomon is also attributed to supplying Israel with chariots and horsemen. Solomon's reign in Israel also resulted in great trade and riches with other countries. Solomon's fame spread to wide that it reached the Queen of Sheba, who immediately went to Jerusalem with a caravan full of gifts. Once she arrived, she was very impressed at his immense wealth.[PARAGRAPH:1]Though Solomon remained devout to God for most of his early life, his late was different. Solomon married 1,000 wives, some of which were foreign. God forbade this for fear their religious practices would corrupt the true worship of God. This is in fact what happened to Solomon. Solomon, out of love for his wives, builds idols for them. Building idols was a very bad sin in the eyes of God. Because Solomon went against God's laws, he cursed Solomon's heir, Rehoboam who lost most of the kingdom.</English>
