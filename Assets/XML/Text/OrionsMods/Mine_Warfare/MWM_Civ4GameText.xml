		<English>The Land Mine is a self-contained explosive device placed on land to destroy ground troops or vehicles. Mines must be armed to explode after reaching their destination, where they are left to wait until they are triggered by contact with an enemy unit.  The exception is the nuclear land mine, which remains dormant until detonated by the owner.  Naval mines can be used offensively, to hamper enemy units or lock them into a peninsula; or defensively, to protect friendly units and create "safe" zones.</English>
