Штрафы:
	[ICON_BULLET]Общий штраф за содержание, так как основы часто упускаются из виду, что приводит к дорогостоящим неудачам, и люди возмущаются более простыми задачами, заставляя их требовать больше для их выполнения;
	[ICON_BULLET]Общая скорость обновления улучшений намного медленнее;
	[ICON_BULLET]Рабочие трудятся намного медленнее;
	[ICON_BULLET]Более высокие затраты на обслуживание из-за количества городов. Ваши люди лучше работают с большими расстояниями между городами, чем если бы они были собраны близко;

	[ICON_BULLET]Ваши отряды проще захватить, поскольку они стремятся идти туда, куда их уносит ветер;
	[ICON_BULLET]Ваши города сильнее страдают от загрязнения воздуха, так как здесь преобладают эксперименты с парами и предпочитают сжигать мусор.

		<English>Negative Trait
"This annoying throng of bureaucrats that surround me are constantly trying to get my attention, embroil me in local politics, and get me to overlook the needs of the rest of the empire and beyond. So frustrating! A decentralized nation is better anyhow."
This leader is very poor at using a super city strategy and is far better at spreading out the efforts of his nation to as many decentralized cities as he can. This isn't that bad a negative trait for a player who prefers not to rely on a few high quality production centers. Your leader tries to avoid governing and prefers to think more on how he's going to expand.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]The Capital produces less Food, Production and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]The Capital produces less Gold, Research, Culture and Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units trained in the capital gain fewer bonus Experience Points than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units Trained in the Holy City of your State Religion gain fewer bonus Experience Points than normal.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Military People are generated slower from battles inside your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]National Wonders are constructed slower in your cities.
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolution option, Holy City instability is increased.
	[ICON_BULLET]Administrative and National Pride Buildings are slower to construct.
	[ICON_BULLET]Administrative and National Pride Buildings generate less to no happiness in your cities.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units gain a bit less experience from combat within your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]Holy Cities of Non-State religions produce units with a penalty to Experience Points.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolution option, distance plays a smaller role in creating instability.
	[ICON_BULLET]Significant decrease in Maintenance from Distance to Capital as you like to spend your time considering how to make a nation that covers more land more efficient.
	[ICON_BULLET]Significant decrease in the Maintenance from Number of Cities since you have found numerous ways to make a country with more decentralization work effectively.
	[ICON_BULLET]Get one more trade route in every city since there is greater cooperation between cities in this sort of nation.
	[ICON_BULLET]Foreign trade routes are more productive since you and your people like to import more examples of what a larger nation can obtain.</English>

		<English>Negative Trait
"This annoying throng of bureaucrats that surround me are constantly trying to get my attention, embroil me in local politics, and get me to overlook the needs of the rest of the empire and beyond. So frustrating! A decentralized nation is better anyhow."
This leader is very poor at using a super city strategy and is far better at spreading out the efforts of his nation to as many decentralized cities as he can. This isn't that bad a negative trait for a player who prefers not to rely on a few high quality production centers. Your leader tries to avoid governing and prefers to think more on how he's going to expand.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]The Capital produces less Food, Production and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]The Capital produces less Gold, Research, Culture and Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units trained in the capital gain significantly fewer bonus Experience Points than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units Trained in the Holy City of your State Religion gain significantly fewer bonus Experience Points than normal.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Military People are generated slower from battles inside your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]National Wonders are constructed slower in your cities.
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolution option, Holy City instability is increased.
	[ICON_BULLET]Administrative and National Pride Buildings are slower to construct.
	[ICON_BULLET]Administrative and National Pride Buildings generate less to no happiness in your cities.
	[ICON_BULLET]The largest cities in your empire are a little less happy, feeling ignored by the leadership.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units gain a bit less experience from combat within your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]Holy Cities of Non-State religions produce units with a penalty to Experience Points.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolution option, distance plays a smaller role in creating instability.
	[ICON_BULLET]Strong decrease in Maintenance from Distance to Capital as you like to spend your time considering how to make a nation that covers more land more efficient.
	[ICON_BULLET]Strong decrease in the Maintenance from Number of Cities since you have found numerous ways to make a country with more decentralization work effectively.
	[ICON_BULLET]Get one more trade route in every city since there is greater cooperation between cities in this sort of nation.
	[ICON_BULLET]Foreign trade routes are more productive since you and your people like to import more examples of what a larger nation can obtain.</English>

		<English>Negative Trait
"Extremely against allowing certain segments of the population an equal status."
Your Leader, and those people among his society that are of a similar heritage, enjoys asserting his dominance and opinions onto others. His nation marginalizes entire ethnic groups, usually those dominated, so as to enforce them into a strong labor pool and regular military force to be exploited to the fullest. There are strong undercurrents of resentment that plague his society but he feels its worth it because his 'type' of person, with his particular faith, is clearly superior and meant to lord over others.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Each non-state religion present in a city adds an unhappiness.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities require slightly more food to grow.
Secondary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all less happy.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great People are slower to be born here where so many are openly oppressed.
	[ICON_BULLET]Time spent in Anarchy when adopting a new State Religion is doubled.
	[ICON_BULLET]You may conscript a few more of your population on a Draft action.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your largest cities are less happy since these communities often have larger groups of the marginalized elements of society.
	[ICON_BULLET]You suffer a Diplomatic penalty since most foreign leaders are either disgusted with your Leader's attitudes or are even personally from the ethnic groups of people your society considers lesser citizens.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your foreign trade routes are less profitable due to your culture's disdain for foreign ethnicities.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from an increase in Crime.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from an increase in Disease.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from a decrease in Education.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Slave type specialists gain an additional Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]Slave type specialists generate an additional Culture and Gold.
	[ICON_BULLET]As soon as you conquer a city, it automatically drafts as much of the population as you can for an immediate unit boost.</English>

		<English>Less happy. Not as quick to birth Great People or grow cities. Stronger slaves, a more conscriptable populace and you draft a segment of any conquered population as soon as you invade a city. Reluctant to adopt new religious views and more judgmental and suppressive of those not adopted, but cities automatically adopt your State Religion. Diplomatic and foreign trade penalty. Suffers from higher crime and disease and lower education.</English>
		<French>Moins heureux. Pas aussi rapide pour faire naître des Personnages illustres ou développer des villes. Des esclaves plus forts et une population plus enrôlable et vous rédigez un segment de toute population conquise dès que vous envahissez une ville. Réticents à adopter de nouvelles opinions religieuses et plus de jugement et de suppression de ceux qui ne sont pas adoptés, mais les villes adoptent automatiquement votre religion d'État. Sanction diplomatique et commerce extérieur. Souffre d'une criminalité et d'une maladie plus élevées et d'une éducation plus faible.</French>

		<English>Negative Trait
"Who cares if our armies are well trained and top notch. Put them under too much pressure and they'll likely run off. They're just there for show mostly anyhow. Since you're so concerned about it, why don't you take charge?"
This leader just doesn't like having to focus on his military forces and lets the organization run itself as much as he can. He doesn't often take the time to reward, train, or discipline his subordinates and as a result, his military can easily end up under trained and unprepared for real conflict.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Less starting Experience points to all units, potentially allowing them to start off at a total deficit of experience.
	[ICON_BULLET]More Experience required for units to gain levels.
	[ICON_BULLET]Significant penalty of experience points given to units trained in the capital. The closer they are to the highest levels command, the more focused training is on style over substance.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Significant reduction in the rate of earning Great Military People.
	[ICON_BULLET]Further reduction in the rate of earning Great Military People when experience accumulated towards that goal is earned within your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military Training Buildings are more expensive to build.
	[ICON_BULLET]Techs that bring military training benefits are slower to discover.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units earn less experience when they fight inside your borders. Familiar places to rest and relax are too readily available.
	[ICON_BULLET]More vulnerable to Espionage since care is not taken with sensitive information.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Generals are less likely to be born as normal Great People.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Slightly increased rate of earning standard Great People. The free time and lack of strong enforcement of military routines allows the military segment the population to explore personal interests and therefore opens up paths to personal achievement.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military units cost less to train and are thus faster to produce since the training is lax.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages are increased by a quarter as long as normal. Relaxed demands and expectations allow people to sustain elation at their accomplishments longer.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units are less expensive to upgrade since quality demands are not as high.</English>

		<English>Positive Trait
"I will not allow them to insult our great nation. They will feel our steel if they dare to disrespect us. If we are strong, we can take what we want when we want it. Want to win on the international stage? Keep your rivals on the defensive."
Sitting back and letting the opponent's forces come to you is the worst approach you can take with this leader. He is far more prepared to launch an attack. Wherever he's taking the fight, he's taking it to his foes. This is a good trait for a raiding playstyle that knocks his foes down with some degree of regularity to keep them all in check. This leader should not fear declaring war over the slightest offense, or even for no justification at all.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Inflicts War Weariness upon enemy players faster than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Reduced cost of upkeep per military unit.
Unique Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Free Aggressive I promotion to all Combatant and Naval Combatant units. Gives a large attack bonus but a small defense penalty.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Increase in the rate of earning Great Military People.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Military People city specialists gain an additional Production each.
	[ICON_BULLET]Combatants and Naval Combatants gain a few extra Experience when trained.
	[ICON_BULLET]Combatants and Naval Combatants are trained faster. The people are entering training more psychologically prepared to unleash their savagery.
	[ICON_BULLET]You suffer less War Weariness.
	[ICON_BULLET]Small increase to the maximum number of population you convert to units during a Conscription action in a city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Gain some Free Military Units that don't require upkeep as normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Somewhat more likely to capture enemy units when defeating them.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units are less likely to be captured when defeated.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Reduction in the rate of earning Great Military People on combats that take place inside your borders. Enough to counter the bonus you get overall so that the bonus ONLY applies when the battle is outside your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]Reduction in the amount of experience earned during fights within your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]Slightly diminished base city defense level.
	[ICON_BULLET]Penalty to diplomacy. This leader is understood to be volatile and likely to seek cause to pick a fight.
	[ICON_BULLET]More expensive to upgrade units. Retraining them in new ways to unleash devastating attacks adds more to training costs.</English>
		<German>Positive Charaktereigenschaft
"Der Angriff ist die beste Verteidigung." - deutsches Sprichwort
Wer es mit einem aggressiven Gegner zu tun bekommt, der sollte sich besser nicht zurücklehnen und abwarten, sondern muss jederzeit mit einem Angriff rechnen. Ein aggressiver Anführer verfügt über ein gut ausgebildetes Militär und ist bereit, beim kleinsten Anlass loszuschlagen. Manchmal erklärt er den Krieg auch ohne jede Rechtfertigung, einfach weil ihm gerade danach ist. Dies ist eine hervorragende Charaktereigenschaft für Spieler, die ihre Gegner mit Militärmacht in die Knie zwingen wollen.
Primäre Vorteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]schnellere Kriegsmüdigkeit bei gegnerischen Nationen
	[ICON_BULLET]reduzierte laufende Kosten für militärische Einheiten
Vorteile für Einheiten:
	[ICON_BULLET]alle Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten erhalten automatisch die Beförderung Aggressiv I
Weitere Vorteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte Geburtenrate für Große Feldherren

	[ICON_BULLET]Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten erhalten beim Training zusätzliche Erfahrungspunkte
	[ICON_BULLET]beschleunigtes Training für Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten (Die Bevölkerung ist auch ohne militärische Ausbildung schon für den Kampf gestählt.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Verminderung der Kriegsmüdigkeit des eigenen Volkes
	[ICON_BULLET]Erhöhung der Anzahl an neuen Militäreinheiten, die über Einberufungsaktionen gewonnen werden können
	[ICON_BULLET]zusätzliche freie Einheiten, für die keine laufenden Kosten anfallen
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte Wahrscheinlichkeit für die Gefangennahme gegnerischer Einheiten
	[ICON_BULLET]verringerte Wahrscheinlichkeit für die Gefangennahme eigener Einheiten
Nachteile:

	[ICON_BULLET]Verminderung der Erfahrungspunkte für Gefechte innerhalb der eigenen Grenzen

		<German>Positive Charaktereigenschaft
"Der Angriff ist die beste Verteidigung." - deutsches Sprichwort
Wer es mit einem aggressiven Gegner zu tun bekommt, der sollte sich besser nicht zurücklehnen und abwarten, sondern muss jederzeit mit einem Angriff rechnen. Ein aggressiver Anführer verfügt über ein gut ausgebildetes Militär und ist bereit, beim kleinsten Anlass loszuschlagen. Manchmal erklärt er den Krieg auch ohne jede Rechtfertigung, einfach weil ihm gerade danach ist. Dies ist eine hervorragende Charaktereigenschaft für Spieler, die ihre Gegner mit Militärmacht in die Knie zwingen wollen.
Primäre Vorteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]schnellere Kriegsmüdigkeit bei gegnerischen Nationen
	[ICON_BULLET]reduzierte laufende Kosten für militärische Einheiten
Vorteile für Einheiten:
	[ICON_BULLET]alle Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten erhalten automatisch die Beförderung Aggressiv
Weitere Vorteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte Geburtenrate für Große Feldherren
	[ICON_BULLET]als angesiedelte Spezialisten bringen Große Feldherren zusätzlich [ICON_PRODUCTION]
	[ICON_BULLET]als angesiedelte Spezialisten bringen Große Feldherren zusätzlich [ICON_GOLD]
	[ICON_BULLET]Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten erhalten beim Training zusätzliche Erfahrungspunkte
	[ICON_BULLET]beschleunigtes Training für Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten (Die Bevölkerung ist auch ohne militärische Ausbildung schon für den Kampf gestählt.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Verminderung der Kriegsmüdigkeit des eigenen Volkes
	[ICON_BULLET]Erhöhung der Anzahl an neuen Militäreinheiten, die über Einberufungsaktionen gewonnen werden können
	[ICON_BULLET]zusätzliche freie Einheiten, für die keine laufenden Kosten anfallen
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte Wahrscheinlichkeit für die Gefangennahme gegnerischer Einheiten
	[ICON_BULLET]verringerte Wahrscheinlichkeit für die Gefangennahme eigener Einheiten
Nachteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]normale Geburtenrate für Große Feldherren bei Gefechten innerhalb der eigenen Grenzen (Der Bonus für Gefechte außerhalb der eigenen Grenzen wird gerade aufgehoben.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Verminderung der Erfahrungspunkte für Gefechte innerhalb der eigenen Grenzen
	[ICON_BULLET]geschwächte Stadtverteidigung
	[ICON_BULLET]Nachteile bei diplomatischen Verhandlungen (Das Staatsoberhaupt gilt als impulsiv und jedes Gegenüber rechnet damit, dass es jederzeit einen Streit vom Zaun bricht.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Preisanstieg für die Modernisierung von Einheiten (Das Austesten neuer Möglichkeiten für vernichtende Angriffe und das Einüben derselben erhöht die Trainingskosten.)</German>

		<English>Positive Trait
"Fertility is the essence of strength. By nurturing the land, you nurture your people and your forces will always be plentiful."

Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all less happy.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great People are slower to be born because your people spend more time laboring in the fields than on personal development.
	[ICON_BULLET]Suffers slightly more Water Pollution.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your citizens suffer minor Education penalties.</English>
		<Russian>Положительная черта
'Плодородие - это сущность силы. Обрабатывая землю, вы заботитесь о своих людях, и у вас всегда все будет в достатке.'
Земля ваша изобильна, однако ваш народ долго и в поте лица трудится от зари до зари, дабы прокормить себя, поэтому у вас остается меньше времени для более сложных дел. Это простая, но эффективная черта для роста, но она также может обеспечить более быстрое обучение военных отрядов.
Основные преимущества:
	[ICON_BULLET]Каждая клетка с +7 [ICON_FOOD] и выше производит дополнительную пищу;
	[ICON_BULLET]Все города получают дополнительную базовую пищу;
	[ICON_BULLET]Все города получают значительный процентный модификатор к пище;
Уникальные способности:
	[ICON_BULLET]Во время обучения любого отряда в городе вся [ICON_FOOD] превращается в доп. [ICON_PRODUCTION];
Побочные преимущества:
	[ICON_BULLET]У ваших горожан меньше проблем со здоровьем благодаря труду на открытом воздухе;
	[ICON_BULLET]Пищевые улучшения производят дополнительную [ICON_FOOD];
	[ICON_BULLET]Сельскохозяйственные постройки на карте улучшаются быстрее, чем обычно;
	[ICON_BULLET]Сельскохозяйственные улучшения ваши рабочие строят намного быстрее;
	[ICON_BULLET]Специалисты Дворянин, Гражданин и Раб производят дополнительную [ICON_FOOD];
	[ICON_BULLET]Заметно быстрее изучаются технологии, ориентированные на сельское хозяйство;
	[ICON_BULLET]Содержание городов значительно сокращено благодаря эффективному озеленению;
Штрафы:
	[ICON_BULLET]Все ваши города менее счастливы;
	[ICON_BULLET]Великие люди рождаются значительно медленнее, поскольку ваш народ тратит больше времени на работу в поле, чем на личное развитие;
	[ICON_BULLET]Цивилизация больше страдает от загрязнения воды;
	[ICON_BULLET]Ваши граждане несут штрафы за образование.

		<English>Negative Trait
"Religion is a manipulative bane to the sanity of the people and a threat to our political power!"
Each negative trait is like tying one of your hands behind your back. This is a textbook example, as you and your people are equally suspicious of anyone trying to instill superstitious belief forms. You may select one to vaguely support, but it is wise to stick to that choice once you've made it and you will struggle to gain much benefit from it over the penalties it invites. There are some side benefits to this approach, but you do miss out on a lot of potential power in the game, though you may find you can achieve more in some ways by ignoring the religious strategy.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Large penalty to Religions Anarchy time, doubling the amount of turns you'd normally suffer to switch religions.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities gain an added unhappiness for each religion maintained in the city, whether it's a state religion or not.
	[ICON_BULLET]Holy Cities produce units that have a percentage less experience.
	[ICON_BULLET]When playing with the Religious Disabling option, all Non-State Religions are inactive, and, depending on civics, if they also bar Non-State Religions, their buildings are destroyed rather than simply disabled.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolutions Option, Holy Cities and the presence of conflicting religions are more likely to cause problems.
	[ICON_BULLET]Missionaries are trained much slower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest type City Specialists are penalized a Production Yield.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest type City Specialists lose an additional Research and Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]Religious and Spiritual technologies are discovered slower.
	[ICON_BULLET]If you have a state religion defined, your cities lose the improved Great People birth rate benefit.
	[ICON_BULLET]Presence of a state religion makes units there take longer to train, enough to counter the Military unit training speed benefit.
	[ICON_BULLET]Presence of a state religion makes buildings there take longer to train, as worship services enforce breaks from labor.
	[ICON_BULLET]You lose an experience point on units trained in any city that has the state religion, countering the overall bonus that normally stems from the self-reliance of being faithless.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Prophets are slightly less likely to be born.
	[ICON_BULLET]All religions are harder to spread.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Increased Rate of Birthing Great People, as humility is not so strong a value in this spiritually untrusting society.
	[ICON_BULLET]War Weariness accumulates slower in your nation as there is little guilt in war among your people, and they are hardened by minimal faith, expecting that their destiny can only lie in their own hands.
	[ICON_BULLET]All units gain a bonus experience point, as your people often rely on themselves for help when they need it, rather than any deity.
	[ICON_BULLET]All Military units are cheaper to build, which is enough to be a bonus if you have no state religion in the city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Allows the nation to produce Inquisitor units once technologically unlocked, that can remove all religions but the state religion in a city.</English>

	[ICON_BULLET]You lose a few experience points on units trained in any city that has the state religion, more than countering the overall bonus that normally stems from the self-reliance of being faithless.

	[ICON_BULLET]All religions are much harder to spread.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Increased Rate of Birthing Great People, as humility is not so strong a value in this spiritually untrusting society.

	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a bonus base Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]War Weariness accumulates slower in your nation as there is little guilt in war among your people, and they are hardened by minimal faith, expecting that their destiny can only lie in their own hands.

	[ICON_BULLET]All Military units are cheaper to build, which is enough to be a bonus if you have no state religion in the city.</English>

		<English>Negative Trait
"Religion is a manipulative bane to the sanity of the people and a threat to our political power!"
Each negative trait is like tying one of your hands behind your back. This is a textbook example, as you and your people are equally suspicious of anyone trying to instill superstitious belief forms. You may select one to vaguely support, but it is wise to stick to that choice once you've made it and you will struggle to gain much benefit from it over the penalties it invites. There are some side benefits to this approach, but you do miss out on a lot of potential power in the game, though you may find you can achieve more in some ways by ignoring the religious strategy.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Huge penalty to Religions Anarchy time, quadrupling the amount of turns you'd normally suffer to switch religions.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities gain an added unhappiness for each religion maintained in the city, whether it's a state religion or not.
	[ICON_BULLET]Holy Cities produce units that have a percentage less experience.
	[ICON_BULLET]When playing with the Religious Disabling option, all Non-State Religions are inactive, and, depending on civics, if they also bar Non-State Religions, their buildings are destroyed rather than simply disabled.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolutions Option, Holy Cities and the presence of conflicting religions are more likely to cause problems.
	[ICON_BULLET]Missionaries are trained much slower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest type City Specialists are penalized a Commerce Yield.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest type City Specialists are penalized a Production Yield.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest type City Specialists lose an additional Gold, Research, Espionage AND Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]Religious and Spiritual technologies are discovered slower.
	[ICON_BULLET]If you have a state religion defined, your cities lose the improved Great People birth rate benefit.
	[ICON_BULLET]Presence of a state religion makes units there take longer to train, enough to counter the Military unit training speed benefit.
	[ICON_BULLET]Presence of a state religion makes buildings there take longer to train, as worship services enforce breaks from labor.
	[ICON_BULLET]You lose an experience point on units trained in any city that has the state religion, countering the overall bonus that normally stems from the self-reliance of being faithless.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Prophets are less likely to be born.
	[ICON_BULLET]All religions are significantly harder to spread.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Increased Rate of Birthing Great People, as humility is not so strong a value in this spiritually untrusting society.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a bonus base Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a bonus base Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]War Weariness accumulates slower in your nation as there is little guilt in war among your people, and they are hardened by minimal faith, expecting that their destiny can only lie in their own hands.
	[ICON_BULLET]All units gain a bonus experience point, as your people often rely on themselves for help when they need it, rather than any deity.
	[ICON_BULLET]All Military units are cheaper to build, which is enough to be a bonus if you have no state religion in the city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden ages last a bit longer because the people take more personal pride in their achievements.
	[ICON_BULLET]Allows the nation to produce Inquisitor units once technologically unlocked, that can remove all religions but the state religion in a city.</English>

"Kill, loot, pillage and burn! What else is being alive for?"
While this leader may not actually BE a barbarian, he certainly prefers being a crude and unrefined type, who sees his more violent and animalistic nature as being the strength he relies on to succeed. He prides himself on it and his people are empowered to let themselves live more wild as a result. This does make for a little stronger military, but generates some serious penalties in the overall results for this nation, primarily penalizing Research, Espionage, Food and Commerce.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a percentage penalty to Research and Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a percentage penalty to Food and Commerce.
Unique Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All Combatant and Naval Combatant units gain the Barbaric I Promotion, which gives a solid bonus to Attack, a small penalty to Defense, and improvements to pillaging.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]You earn Great People significantly slower than normal since your people often spend their time and resources on simpler pursuits.
	[ICON_BULLET]World Wonders are slower to construct. The planning and execution required to construct these impressive works usually requires more focus and attention than these citizens have the capacity for.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a penalty to base Research and Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a penalty to base Food and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Routes are built significantly slower by your workers. Who needs roads?
	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements upgrade slower on their own since taking the time to improve their operations is not something the citizenry tends to spend their time investing into.
	[ICON_BULLET]You suffer a Diplomatic penalty due to your inability to take care with your expressions.
	[ICON_BULLET]The least anarchy this nation can experience when making policy changes is one round. It's hard to get this rabble to get back to work after periods of unrest until their enjoyment of unstructured experience runs its course.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units are slightly more expensive to update as getting them to focus during retraining is difficult.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]It takes a bit less experience for your units to gain levels since they are naturally savage fighters.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your people suffer from slightly less War Weariness since violence and combat are second nature.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military units are slightly faster to train. The people are easily invited into military service since it lets them unleash their wild sides.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your people forgive being whipped to rush construction and training under slavery faster than usual since it's more understandable to them that people only listen to threats of force.</English>

"A leader derives all power from his people. Persuasion is therefore the ultimate key."
The ability to earn respect and persuade others is one of the most critical skills to possess in any profession, most of all in being a leader. When your people WANT to obey your directives, and your rivals enjoy your company and respect your capacity for cooperative action and problem resolution, the world tends to respond to your will with much greater ease. You may tend to be overly chatty at times and let certain things slip that you shouldn't, however, and many who live under your rule may consider you so great a role model that they also have similar problems, so espionage is your primary drawback.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units require significantly less experience points to level thanks to their high degree of morale and inspiration your leader's words have inspired.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a percentage modifier to Production and Commerce.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all happier thanks to your inspiring and rousing speeches making them confident in the leadership here.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities get an additional base Production and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Artist and Detective Type Specialists cost an Espionage each. Expressive and deeply connected citizens often give away more state secrets than they mean to.
	[ICON_BULLET]War Weariness is reduced for this nation because your leader is so good at selling the reasons for conflicts.
	[ICON_BULLET]An extra citizen can be drafted during a conscription action in a city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Each military unit staffed in a city always provides an additional happiness since the people trust that the intentions of the military are purely to protect and serve them.
	[ICON_BULLET]You gain a Diplomatic bonus.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages last a bit longer in this proud nation.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer from a reduction of a base Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a percentage penalty to Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]It is easier for opponents to perform Espionage missions in your cities.</English>

"Who cares what the people think or feel? All that matters is that they perform for me. If they fear me, they will perform."
Perhaps the most loathsome leaders of all time have been ones that clearly show a disdain for any concern for his subjects. It has been said that leaders can influence with love or fear and this one certainly relies on fear, favoring huge punishments and public displays of torture. He spends time and government resources on inventing new ways to toy with people to show how powerless they are against the authority this leader wields. His people have been taught to bully one another and establish strong hierarchies of leadership that actively look for reasons to flaunt their power.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Cities are much less Healthy.

	[ICON_BULLET]Most combat capable units gain the Cruel I Promotion. It diminishes withdrawal, gives a solid combat modifier and causes the unit to spread a bit of crime.
Side Penalties:

	[ICON_BULLET]Great People are born less frequently in this oppressed country.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are less stable on the Revolution option.

	[ICON_BULLET]Citizen and Slave Type Specialists cost a Culture each.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Largest cities are less happy because they tend to catch the brunt of it.
	[ICON_BULLET]You gain a Diplomatic penalty since even other leaders see you as a demon to be dispatched.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages don't last as long when you or those you know are suffering.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from somewhat increased Crime levels.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from somewhat increased Disease levels.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]World Wonders are constructed faster under threats of great pain if project timeline goals are not met.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest Type Specialists gain a Production each because they push others to work harder.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest Type Specialists gain an additional Espionage by putting their talents to torture.
	[ICON_BULLET]This nation suffers from less War Weariness because they embrace opportunities to make others suffer.
	[ICON_BULLET]You can draft a few more citizens than normal with a conscript action.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Military units are slightly faster to train because many of your people are well prepared to unleash their pain on others.

"Budget is no object. I shall have a massive army at my disposal and everything I want. I am King, am I not?"

	[ICON_BULLET]All cities lose a base Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities lose a percentage penalty to Commerce.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]An extra unhappiness in every city.
	[ICON_BULLET]All trade routes lose a percentage penalty to Commerce.

'Бюджет не имеет значения. В моем распоряжении будет огромная армия и все, что я пожелаю. Государь я или нет?'
Ваш народ изрядно пострадал из-за ваших злоупотреблений властью, но из-за своего отчаянного экономического положения они быстро согласятся устроиться на правительственных подрядах в строительстве и служить в армии. Перерасход и неспособность разумно инвестировать приводит к дефициту бюджета.
Основные штрафы:
	[ICON_BULLET]Любая клетка, производящая +7 и более [ICON_GOLD], получает штраф -1 к доходам;
	[ICON_BULLET]Базовые доходы снижены во всех городах;
	[ICON_BULLET]Все города получают процентный штраф к [ICON_GOLD];

	[ICON_BULLET]Все торговые пути получают процентный штраф к [ICON_GOLD];
	[ICON_BULLET]Все торговые улучшения дают меньше коммерции;
	[ICON_BULLET]Заметно медленнее обычного обновляются торговые улучшения;
	[ICON_BULLET]Заметно медленнее строятся торговые улучшения вашими рабочими;
	[ICON_BULLET]Специалисты типа Адвокат, Гражданин и Раб поставляют меньше доходов;

Преимущества:
	[ICON_BULLET]Чудеса Света строятся быстрее;
	[ICON_BULLET]Национальные чудеса строятся быстрее;
	[ICON_BULLET]Командные проекты строятся быстрее;
	[ICON_BULLET]Вы можете призывать в войска несколько больше граждан, чем обычно;
	[ICON_BULLET]Заметно сокращается содержание городов из-за того, что многие долги бюджета остаются неоплаченными;

"Only a large and populace nation can command great power. Land is the only real commodity."
For players that race other nations to capture and develop as much real estate as they can as fast as they can, this trait is the perfect selection. It supercharges workers and settlers and even supports a larger empire with reduced size based maintenance factors. Your people, just as your leader, are impatient to branch out, so patient research and impressive works are less important here.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a percentage modifier to Food and Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]Settlers are trained much faster than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers are trained significantly faster than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements organically upgrade twice as fast as usual.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers are far faster at improving your territory.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolutions option, instability from the distance to capital is reduced.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities all produce an extra base Food and Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]Upkeep from the Distance to Capital is reduced.
	[ICON_BULLET]Upkeep from Number of Cities is reduced.
	[ICON_BULLET]You get a bonus amount of Free Units derived from a small percentage of your overall Population.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Largest Cities are happier since your citizens feel a sense of accomplishment in a highly populated area.
Penalties:

	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all penalized with one less base Research.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities all suffer from a percentage reduction to Research.

"Nothing can't be bought so proper investments cannot fail to achieve victory."
Few nations like to think their rulers waste the taxes that are collected and this one can show a nicely balanced budget that plans each measure of spending quite carefully to get the maximum results. The leader is a genius when it comes to finances but may shave corners in a few areas that could lead to some dangerous results for the nation. Regardless, wealth is clearly more easily obtained within these borders, which is an envious position to be in.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities produce a couple more base Gold.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a percentage modifier to Gold.
	[ICON_BULLET]All Specialists produce an extra Gold.
	[ICON_BULLET]The cost of rushing buildings and units is reduced significantly.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all happier with greater wealth going around and more fiscal responsibility in government.
	[ICON_BULLET]The overall upkeep expense for this nation is reduced.
	[ICON_BULLET]More Great People are born here because financial opportunities to invest into personal achievements are more readily available.
	[ICON_BULLET]Buildings that are focused on wealth generation are faster to build.
	[ICON_BULLET]Merchant type Specialists generate an additional Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Citizen and Slave type Specialists give an additional Gold.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Capital produces a small percentage more Gold.
	[ICON_BULLET]Technologies that lead to wealth improvements are faster to discover.
	[ICON_BULLET]Corporate Maintenance is reduced. Corporations benefit from more relaxed policies that help them get more out of their investments.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Merchants are more likely to be born.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy times are a bit longer. It takes longer to figure out how to optimize spending in a new governmental structure.
	[ICON_BULLET]All Improvements take a lot longer to upgrade naturally since your nation refuses to budget for such projects until absolutely necessary.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers take longer to place Improvements because they tend to get things done on a shoestring budget.
	[ICON_BULLET]All units receive a little less investment into training thus lose an Experience when trained.
	[ICON_BULLET]Shaving costs on defensive preparations leads to a slightly reduced City Defense Modifier.
	[ICON_BULLET]Espionage Defense is slightly reduced due to underspending on security monitoring.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your defenses are somewhat more easily bombarded due to cutting costs in material expenses when constructing your fortifications.
	[ICON_BULLET]It takes slightly more food to grow your cities. With less government funding for family support programs, there is more reluctance to raise children until the providers have more firmly established their careers.
	[ICON_BULLET]Slightly higher Crime rate. More wealth circulating in your communities means there is a bit more to commit crimes.</English>

"I know not everyone understands where I'm coming from here. But if you can see our nation the way I do, from the unique perspective I have here, you would understand why I support these policies."
The people aren't entirely behind this Leader.

	[ICON_BULLET]Corporation Maintenance is reduced since your leader is against international tariffs.
	[ICON_BULLET]You gain a Diplomatic bonus. World leaders respect your mixed heritage and some may even feel they have a special inroad with you as a result.

"We were meant to live simply. Throwing off the balance of nature by trying to become more than our natural selves is bound to have severe and serious consequences. We must stay as simple and in harmony as possible, using only what we need and living only in the now."
His heart is in the right place in thinking that Humankind is likely to eventually destroy itself and its planet by its own nature. Therefore urges his people to live simply, don't try to overly compete with one another and other nations, and treat the Earth with respect. While this may be a very good person, he doesn't make a solid competitor.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities produce a percentage less Gold, Research, Culture and Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities produce a percentage less Production.
Secondary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Great People are slower to be born here due to competition being frowned upon.
	[ICON_BULLET]All Wonder Types are slower to be constructed since this leader does not prioritize anything that will make his nation stand out.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities generate one less Research and Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements are far slower to naturally upgrade since there is natural reluctance among the people to update to the latest technologies.
	[ICON_BULLET]Upkeep from the Number of Cities in your empire is higher. It costs more to minimize the impact of Humanity in a larger empire.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your largest cities are less happy since urban living is more fast-paced than your people prefer.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from a penalty to Education. While those researchers on the cutting edge aren't begrudged, most people prefer to let it all go over their heads.
Benefits:

"There's no problems in MY empire! Everything's rosy over here! I'm quite certain everything is going perfectly according to plan..."
Some people believe that if they imagine problems away, they won't really exist. That's how this Leader approaches challenges, and as a result, he runs an inefficient empire. He takes major upkeep hits for letting the organization go lax. The rosy attitude does well in diplomacy and often promotes a view on war that everything's going just fine (even when its not but it helps the public morale) and lackadaisical approach to assigning policies streamlines anarchy times.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Cities all suffer a minor percentage penalty to Food, Production, and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Cities all suffer a minor percentage penalty to Gold, Research, Culture, and Espionage.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units are more lackadaisically trained and start with a one less Experience Point.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are a little less defended since dangers are ignored.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer a touch more Crime.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer a touch more Disease.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities struggle with a tiny bit less Education.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all happier since the leader always paints a pretty picture of how things are.
	[ICON_BULLET]Overall Upkeep is reduced because this leader tends to underspend with the optimism that problems will take care of themselves.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Distance to Capital is lower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is lower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Corporation Maintenance is lower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your largest cities are happier because you like to heap praise on your leading metropolitan centers.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Military units are slightly faster to train since training isn't taken as seriously.</English>

		<English>Positive Trait
"Take what they have and make it your own. Establish proper governance in the foreign lands and the world falls like dominoes at your feet."
With this leader, you may wish to let your neighbors expand and place their cities and grow while you focus instead on developing a devastating city attack force to take all their achievements right out from underneath them. Your people are envious and savagely willing and empowered to act on your goals of conquest.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Free Imperial I promotion to all Combatant units. Strong city attack modifier and some side benefits that help your units maintain new cities.
Unique Abilities:
	[ICON_BULLET]Whenever you capture a city you instantly get a number of free defenders drafted from the population of that city, based on the number of citizens you can conscript.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities construct Siege based and Siege supporting buildings faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Military People Specialists gain an additional Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Techs that support and unlock Siege units are faster to research.
	[ICON_BULLET]Siege units gain extra free experience.
	[ICON_BULLET]Siege units are faster to train.
	[ICON_BULLET]Increase to the maximum number of population you convert to units during a Conscription action in a city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Lower Maintenance costs from Distance to Capital. Planning to conquer so much territory, your people are more efficient at maintaining larger empires with larger areas.
	[ICON_BULLET]Lower Maintenance costs from Number of Cities.
	[ICON_BULLET]Gain a bonus amount of Free Military Units from the total population of your nation.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units gain more experience when trained in your capital. Your seat of power is the beating heart of the will to dominate all foes.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units are more likely to capture defeated enemy units due to their practice at establishing dominance and control over the defeated.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units are less likely to be captured when defeated because they are too used to being dominant and cannot stand the idea of such submission.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Slightly reduced rate of birthing Great People since your culture is so focused on taking the achievements of others they tend to undervalue personal achievements.
	[ICON_BULLET]Takes a diplomatic penalty because few foreign powers are comfortable knowing that this leader's goal is to take over the world.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units are slightly more expensive to upgrade because keeping up on the specialized invasion training can get costly.
	[ICON_BULLET]Crime is more difficult to control since so many among your society feel dominated and resentful of it.</English>

		<English>Positive Trait
"Our nation should be a forerunner, creating and discovering new and valuable things to share with the rest of the world at a profit."
Previously known as 'Progressist', this leader is enamored by new things and quickly tires of 'yesterday's news'. This can be problematic for the leader on an interpersonal level but it serves his people rather well, who are inspired to press the bounds of known design and function and to apply the latest developments as quickly as they can nation-wide. As a result, the nation always has neat things to trade to other countries and between its own cities, and its always on the lookout for a way to impress the world with new wondrous things, including buildings. All this does enhance the overall upkeep expenses a bit. The leader and his people can also suffer some from impatience.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a percentage modifier to Research and Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a percentage modifier to Production and Commerce.
Unique Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units can upgrade wherever they are as long as they do have access where they are to any required buildings and resources.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain an additional base Research and Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain an additional base Production and Commerce.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Overall Upkeep is higher as operating a nation on the constant cutting edge makes for an expensive policy.
	[ICON_BULLET]National Wonders are slower to be constructed since they aren't as impressive since all nations can get something like it.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your nation accumulates War Weariness faster since war can distract from innovation.
	[ICON_BULLET]Anarchy time when changing Civics is a little longer since the impatience your people have for policy changes, and the constant suggestion of new ways to address little issues that a new policy introduces, adds to the frustration to getting things smoothed out.
	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements upgrade much slower than normal because the people are impatiently waiting for workers to get it done immediately rather than taking the time themselves to update the land they operate themselves.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers are a bit slower because they are always looking for ways to do things in a new and improved fashion and have a hard time focusing on repetitive processes involved in getting things done.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your nation gets fewer base free military units because even your soldiers balk at getting hand-me-down equipment.
	[ICON_BULLET]The constant need to make sure that everything is as fully considered for new adjustments during times of policy change ensures that any Anarchy Period takes at least a round at minimum, which may be adjusted by game speed.</English>

	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements upgrade much slower than normal because the people are impatiently waiting for workers to get it done immediately rather than taking the time themselves to update the land they operate themselves.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers are slower because they are always looking for ways to do things in a new and improved fashion and have a hard time focusing on repetitive processes involved in getting things done.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your nation gets fewer base free military units because even your soldiers balk at getting hand-me-down equipment.
	[ICON_BULLET]The constant need to make sure that everything is as fully considered for new adjustments during times of policy change ensures that any Anarchy Period takes at least three rounds at minimum, which may be adjusted by game speed.</English>

		<English>Positive Trait
"Our nation should be a forerunner, creating and discovering new and valuable things to share with the rest of the world at a profit."
Previously known as 'Progressist', this leader is enamored by new things and quickly tires of 'yesterday's news'. This can be problematic for the leader on an interpersonal level but it serves his people rather well, who are inspired to press the bounds of known design and function and to apply the latest developments as quickly as they can nation-wide. As a result, the nation always has neat things to trade to other countries and between its own cities, and its always on the lookout for a way to impress the world with new wondrous things, including buildings. All this does enhance the overall upkeep expenses a bit. The leader and his people can also suffer some from impatience.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a percentage modifier to Research and Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a percentage modifier to Production and Commerce.
Unique Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units can upgrade wherever they are as long as they do have access where they are to any required buildings and resources.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]World Wonders and Team Projects are constructed significantly faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain an additional base Research and Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain an additional base Production and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities get an additional Trade Route since they generate such unique items other locales desire.
	[ICON_BULLET]Foreign Trade Routes are more profitable.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Overall Upkeep is significantly higher as operating a nation on the constant cutting edge makes for an expensive policy.
	[ICON_BULLET]National Wonders are slower to be constructed since they aren't as impressive since all nations can get something like it.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your nation accumulates War Weariness faster since war can distract from innovation.
	[ICON_BULLET]Anarchy time when changing Civics is a little longer since the impatience your people have for policy changes, and the constant suggestion of new ways to address little issues that a new policy introduces, adds to the frustration to getting things smoothed out.
	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements upgrade much slower than normal because the people are impatiently waiting for workers to get it done immediately rather than taking the time themselves to update the land they operate themselves.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers are a bit slower because they are always looking for ways to do things in a new and improved fashion and have a hard time focusing on repetitive processes involved in getting things done.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your nation gets fewer base free military units because even your soldiers balk at getting hand-me-down equipment.
	[ICON_BULLET]The constant need to make sure that everything is as fully considered for new adjustments during times of policy change ensures that any Anarchy Period takes at least a few rounds at minimum, which may be adjusted by game speed.</English>

"All those other nations are only out to take advantage of us and even their trades are barbed with deception and entrapment!"
Some nations throughout history have thrived with a xenophobic focus on themselves and internal matters and doing their best to block out the rest of the world and its affairs. This leader certainly tries this approach as much as possible and has convinced his people to adopt similar views. They frown on travel and tourism and are a defensive breed. This serves them in many ways but also impedes the nation from benefiting much from trade.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All Trade Routes are significantly less productive with yields generated.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities may maintain one less Trade Route than the normal limit.
	[ICON_BULLET]All Foreign Trade Routes are even less productive with yields generated.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Merchant Type Specialists generate one less Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Trade Units are trained with one less Experience Point.
	[ICON_BULLET]Trade Units are trained slower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic changes cause more rounds of Anarchy as cooperation is not a cultural strong suit here.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Distance to Capital is increased since your people don't like to travel.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from the Number of Cities is increased since your people prefer a smaller nation with fewer cultural differences and the wider they are spread, the more they conflict internally, leading to unique support costs.
	[ICON_BULLET]Each of your cities lose a Trade Route.
	[ICON_BULLET]You gain a Diplomatic penalty with other Leaders since you simply don't like spending time with them and would prefer they stay home rather than visit.
	[ICON_BULLET]Loses some Tourism in all your cities.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Generals are faster to emerge from battles in your borders since your people are more deeply offended by intrusions.
	[ICON_BULLET]National Wonders are faster to construct since anything intended to support the nation is a higher priority than usual.
	[ICON_BULLET]An additional citizen may be drafted during a conscription action.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units gain more experience during combat inside your borders since your people are highly territorial.
	[ICON_BULLET]Cities have higher City Defense levels since they are cleverly designed to keep others out.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are harder to perform Espionage Missions in for your enemies. Your xenophobic citizens rarely offer any trust to outsiders.</English>

"I was born to rule the Earth! None shall stand in my way! Advisors? Bah! Nobody knows better than I!"
Some of your people may be enamored with this leader's unshakable projection of confidence. But one of the problems in the world is that stupid people have the confidence to take the lead while the intelligent ones are often too cautious with responsibility. This nation suffers from overspending and impulsiveness and an inability to get their leader to see reason when it can be desperately important that he understands he doesn't have all the answers all the time. Intelligent people who live under this rule are deeply embarrassed by this leader.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a percentage penalty to Gold and Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a percentage penalty to Food and Production.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Overall upkeep is a little increased due to unwise spending and policies.
	[ICON_BULLET]National Wonders and Team Projects are slower to construct since sharing in the glory of an accomplishment and construction projects that support local needs are not inspiring to this leader.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a reduction in base Gold and Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a reduction in base Food and Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]Gains a penalty to Diplomacy.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are easier to perform espionage missions against since your leader often publicizes secrets in the act of bragging.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your people take more time in resent for being whipped to rush constructions and training during slavery since many do not approve of the leader's choices in the first place.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer a little more from Crime since the people are resistant to this leader's laws.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Great People are slightly faster to be born because the people are inspired to have confidence in themselves.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Military People emerge slightly faster because the military gets frustrated with being led poorly so those who want to improve things rise to the occasion faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]World Wonders are faster to build since the leader loves to budget for anything that assuages his ego.
	[ICON_BULLET]Anarchy time when changing Civics is significantly shorter since this leader does not tolerate delays in his policy decisions.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military units are faster to train since the leader pushes his training programs with immense impatience.</English>

"A well ordered hierarchy established throughout the nation will lead to streamlined efforts and balanced budgets."
Everything is done in a careful and well planned manner here. This can slow things down but also leads to extreme efficiency in providing quality services to the nation. The most powerful aspect of this trait is how greatly it diminishes upkeep costs. Your military is a bit more restrained than it should be and therefore suffers for your organizational efforts. The longest projects are made faster with this approach and overall, more tends to get done by your people. Putting such a high value on planning and execution does diminish creativity some. Obviously some trying times of preparation can take longer since your government is instructed to do what it must to prepare for new ways to be introduced.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Overall Upkeep is strongly reduced.
	[ICON_BULLET]All specialists give an extra Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Distance to Capital is tremendously diminished.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is hugely reduced.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Team Projects are completed significantly faster since proper planning at the beginning of the project leads to efficiencies that help the project finish ahead of time.
	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements naturally upgrade far faster due to preparations for improvement being taken all along.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers are much faster at building improvements since things are well planned out before they even begin.
	[ICON_BULLET]You gain a number of Free Units that require no support.
	[ICON_BULLET]You gain yet more Free Units that require no support from a small percentage of your overall population.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your largest cities are happier than normal due to impressive urban planning making life easier on its citizens.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military Units are faster to train because the training regimen is so well planned out.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]It takes a bit more experience for your units to level and thus gain promotions.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Military People are somewhat slower to emerge since your people rarely take inspired action without careful consideration.
	[ICON_BULLET]Artist and Slave type Specialists are less inspired so produce one less Culture each.
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy time is longer due to the patient planning your leader insists on being taken with any policy changes.</English>

"What is life for? Are we not here to discover our true purpose and live that purpose? We were all born for a reason, born to contribute something special. We should support and enable each other to bring each other's unique gifts to bear for the nation."
Your leader is a deep thinker who inspires the nation to produce individuals of the same nature. Some may suspect him of being a member of an elite secret society, and he may be. He certainly offers as much national support to the development of those with promise as he can. Unfortunately, smarter citizens are more likely to commit crime, thinking it to be a great way to test their intelligence against the system.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Great People are born much faster in this nation.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a percentage modifier to Research and Gold.
	[ICON_BULLET]All Specialists produce an extra Commerce.
Unique Benefits:

	[ICON_BULLET]Engineer Type Specialists give an extra Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities get a few more Great People rate points each round, not dedicated to any particular type of specialist.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Overall upkeep is higher due to some unusual programs supporting grants and other independent efforts that show promise.
	[ICON_BULLET]Citizen and Slave Type Specialists lose the extra Commerce all other specialists give.
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy periods last a little longer since more thought goes into trying to find the best ways to establish policy.
	[ICON_BULLET]The unhappiness from whip rushing construction and training lasts longer here than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Since people here often try to take longer to establish themselves in their careers before forming families, cities take more food to grow.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from extra Crime rates since even those with criminal minds feel empowered to find their calling as well.</English>

	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy periods last a little longer since more thought goes into trying to find the best ways to establish policy.
	[ICON_BULLET]The unhappiness from whip rushing construction and training lasts longer here than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Since people here often try to take longer to establish themselves in their careers before forming families, cities take more food to grow.
	[ICON_BULLET]All Religions are a little harder to spread since people are more inclined to think for themselves.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from extra Crime rates since even those with criminal minds feel empowered to find their calling as well.</English>

"What is life for? Are we not here to discover our true purpose and live that purpose? We were all born for a reason, born to contribute something special. We should support and enable each other to bring each other's unique gifts to bear for the nation."
Your leader is a deep thinker who inspires the nation to produce individuals of the same nature. Some may suspect him of being a member of an elite secret society, and he may be. He certainly offers as much national support to the development of those with promise as he can.

"Government is a complex machine, which requires constant tweaking and adjusting to get the best performance. The most adaptable government will survive."
If you really hate anarchy periods after changing civics, this is your go-to pick. And although you will have very strong culture and espionage, you will also suffer from greatly increased maintenance struggles. Diplomacy with other leaders is also a strong suit.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a percentage modifier to Culture and Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]Anarchy Time from changing Civics is dramatically reduced.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units trained in the capital gain a percentage adjustment to their starting Experience Points.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]National Wonders are constructed significantly faster since they are a reflection of good governing.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain an extra base Culture and Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your capital gets a small percentage bonus to Food, Production and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Spy Type Specialists gain an extra Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Capital gains a percentage modifier to Culture and Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]You gain a Diplomatic bonus.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]General Upkeep is significantly higher since this leader finds it very important to uphold all of his many promises to his people.
	[ICON_BULLET]World Wonders are significantly slower to construct since such projects are always secondary in priority to more local needs being met first.
	[ICON_BULLET]War Weariness accumulates faster for this nation, which likes to believe that proper governing involves avoiding warfare.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Distance to Palace is higher due to never shortcutting on costs to keep the government running at peak condition.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is higher since the costs normally associated with this upkeep are intensified by attempts to spare no expense for quality results.
	[ICON_BULLET]This nation suffers a small Education penalty. True politicians are a little too aware that citizens are more easily swayed when not as Educated.</English>

"Societal elite are all in cahoots with each other forming a master plot to take over all sovereign nations for themselves and only I seem to understand this!"
It may seem strange that any leader would want to ensure that people in his society don't try to stand out as strongly valuable contributors but when people of high quality come under immediate suspicion of being potential threats, rivals, and conspirators, folks tend to keep a low profile and achieve more silently if at all. That's what happens in this leader's nation, but on the plus side, the truly common person actually does benefit a bit more from some of the programs designed to benefit the masses, so long as they stay in their lanes.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Great People are born much slower in this nation.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a percentage penalty to Research and Gold.
	[ICON_BULLET]All Specialists cost one Commerce.
Side Penalties:

	[ICON_BULLET]All cities get one less Free Specialist. Nobody wants to stand out for doing more than their fair share.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities have their Great People accumulation points reduced by a few.
	[ICON_BULLET]Education levels are somewhat penalized. Your citizens are conditioned to feel that being overly educated is a form of arrogance that attracts the wrong kind of attention.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]General Upkeep is reduced since the funds usually channeled to elite members of society and education grants are withheld.
	[ICON_BULLET]Citizen and Slave Type Specialists gain back the Commerce all other specialists lose.
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy periods don't last quite as long since fewer people feel they should contribute to the policy debates.
	[ICON_BULLET]You can draft an extra citizen than normal since people are happy to abandon individualism to be a part of something greater than themselves.

	[ICON_BULLET]Religious Anarchy time is greatly increased since your people have a hard time adopting new ideas on faith alone.
	[ICON_BULLET]Even your State Religion elicits an additional unhappiness wherever it has spread.
	[ICON_BULLET]Non-state religions are even more difficult for your people to tolerate so each adds an unhappiness wherever it is found among your cities.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military units are slower to train. Your citizens are reluctant to be considered brutish warriors.
	[ICON_BULLET]All Religions are harder to spread, non-State Religions a bit tougher still.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer an increased amount of Air Pollution. A lot of experiments involve exotic gasses and chemicals and technology is often based on ways to apply fire.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are a little more Educated since knowledge is a social value in your nation.</English>

Есть ли что-нибудь более выгодное, чем ускорение темпов исследований? Превосходство ваших соперников в техническом прогрессе - самая фундаментальная стратегия победы в любой игре Civilization во всех ее версиях. Однако есть некоторые неудобства, с которыми вам придется столкнуться здесь, и вы можете найти некоторых других лидеров с другими чертами, которые находят способы компенсировать эту разницу, могут бросить вызов и угрожать вам, независимо от вашего небольшого научного преимущества.

"Command the seas and you command the world."
The majority of the Earth is covered in water. Waterways are the crossing points where most nations are vulnerable, in transportation of land forces, trade routes and supply lines. When your people consider themselves more at home on the waves than they are on land, we can capitalize on the great power this brings. It also allows us to make the most of the sea's bountiful resources.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Free Amphibious promotion for Explorers, Melee, Mounted and Throwing unit types so they can ignore naval assault and river crossing penalties.
	[ICON_BULLET]Free Seafaring I promotion for all Naval units, giving a solid combat modifier and mobility benefit.
	[ICON_BULLET]Working any Sea Domain plot produces an additional Production.
Unique Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Naval transport ships all gain an additional cargo space, or a strong volume capacity boost.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Water based improvements that can upgrade do so much faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]Water based improvements that take time to build will be constructed faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Admiral Specialists gain an additional Food yield.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Admiral Specialists gain two additional Research.
	[ICON_BULLET]Sea Domain units gain a few bonus experience points when trained.
	[ICON_BULLET]Sea Domain units are faster to train.
	[ICON_BULLET]Techs that give sea travel and warfare benefits are faster to discover.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Admirals are birthed faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]All coastal cities gain an additional trade route if they can reach another coastal city in the trade network.
	[ICON_BULLET]Many resources derived from naval plots give extra happiness in all your cities. Your people love seafood and are proud of what they bring up from the depths.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Health penalty. Drowning deaths are common.
	[ICON_BULLET]Overall upkeep is slightly higher since so much focus goes into utilizing the ocean, increasing the costs and investments necessary to do so.
	[ICON_BULLET]Many land based improvements aren't as valuable. For example, Mines get less Production and Farms get less Food.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers lose a quarter of their productivity speed.
	[ICON_BULLET]Higher Maintenance costs from Number of Cities. Naval transportation costs to support a nation's infrastructure needs are usually a little higher maintenance and land locked cities are more resentfully supported.
	[ICON_BULLET]The largest cities in your nation are less happy. Your people are more introverted, being accustomed to the relative isolation experienced on naval voyages.</English>

"Knowing the nature of self is all important to achieving all things. Seek truth through fully understanding all religions."
It has been said that every religion is a different blind man reaching out and feeling different parts of God and their conflicts and disagreements purely stem from having a limited perspective, but all have elements of the truth infused in them, along with misinformation to cover up gaps in the extent of the understanding each possesses. All religions are efforts to explain those things that cannot be proven, things like the meaning of life and its purpose.

"What? You DARE to defy ME? Off with his head! Oh, he's a foreign leader is he? Well then... this means WAR!"
Sometimes leaders let the power really get to their heads and they start to act like insolent children, but since they are the ones defining the law and the direction of the nation, they have the authority to do tremendous damage with this abuse. Loyalties can be challenged and morale can suffer but the fear generated by this type of leader can serve them in a few ways.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units require significantly more experience points to level since they so greatly resent the treatment they suffer.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a percentage penalty to Production and Commerce.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all less happy under your heavy handed rule.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities are penalized by one less base Production and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]War Weariness is significantly increased for this nation because your leader comes across as willing to fight without good cause.
	[ICON_BULLET]Fewer citizens can be drafted during a conscription action in a city.
	[ICON_BULLET]You suffer a Diplomatic penalty.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages last a bit shorter in this fearful nation.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your citizens resent being whipped to rush construction and training longer.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy periods are significantly reduced in fear of your leader's wrath at any delays in establishing policy changes.
	[ICON_BULLET]It is harder for opponents to perform Espionage missions in your cities for fear of your leader's retribution.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your enemies suffer from greater War Weariness since the people of rival nations find you frighteningly irrational.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from less crime than usual since punishments are severe.</English>

"Everything they have is better than what we have. We need to spend our time trying to emulate them so we can have those things too! Trade with them to learn their superior ways!"
The jealousy this leader feels impedes his ability to inspire his people to opening up to their own creativity, instead always looking to have the shiny new objects circulating through other nations. He's always disappointed with the accomplishments of his own nation and fails to recognize their achievements, leaving them demoralized in their efforts and feeling like it's just not their role to generate the new things in the world but to collect what others have made instead.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer from a percentage penalty to Research and Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer from a percentage penalty to Production and Commerce.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]World Wonders are constructed slower. It is demotivating to think nothing will impress their leader despite their best efforts.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a penalty of a base Research and Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a penalty of a base Production and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]The largest cities in your nation are a little less happy since they live with such strong envy of other metropolitan centers they could never possibly be as impressive as.
	[ICON_BULLET]Anarchy periods last at least as long as a round, possibly scaled by game speed. Although quick to adopt a solution when it is found, an exhaustive research of the best ways to implement a policy that have been shown by other nations must be undertaken first.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages don't last as long thanks to the underlying feeling of inner disappointment that drags down the mood of the people.
	[ICON_BULLET]Anger from using slavery to whip rush construction and training lasts longer than normal due to resent by the people for being apparently so poor at getting things done that they must be pushed to such suffering.
	[ICON_BULLET]Rushing construction and training with gold costs more, as the people are not capable of responding to money motivation in their demoralized state.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units are a little more expensive to train because you always want to make sure they have the best weaponry, even if it costs you more for ineffective gains.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]War Weariness is not as strong against your people who see war as an opportunity to take the works of others.
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy time is diminished since your bureaucrats are quick to settle on sufficient solutions to policy decisions that are as close to a copy of what others have established elsewhere as possible.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers are faster since they keep designs as basic and functional as possible.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities get an additional trade route since your merchants are always looking to get what others have.
	[ICON_BULLET]Foreign Trade Routes are more profitable since your people are always hungry to buy things from foreign lands.</English>

	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements upgrade naturally much faster since best practices are rapidly adopted once invented.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers are faster since they keep designs as basic and functional as possible.

"Everything they have is better than what we have. We need to spend our time trying to emulate them so we can have those things too! Trade with them to learn their superior ways!"
The jealousy this leader feels impedes his ability to inspire his people to opening up to their own creativity, instead always looking to have the shiny new objects circulating through other nations. He's always disappointed with the accomplishments of his own nation and fails to recognize their achievements, leaving them demoralized in their efforts and feeling like it's just not their role to generate the new things in the world but to collect what others have made instead.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer from a percentage penalty to Research and Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer from a percentage penalty to Production and Commerce.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]World Wonders and Team Projects are constructed significantly slower. It is demotivating to think nothing will impress their leader despite their best efforts.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a penalty of a base Research and Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a penalty of a base Production and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]The largest cities in your nation are a little less happy since they live with such strong envy of other metropolitan centers they could never possibly be as impressive as.
	[ICON_BULLET]Anarchy periods last at least as long as a few rounds, possibly scaled by game speed. Although quick to adopt a solution when it is found, an exhaustive research of the best ways to implement a policy that have been shown by other nations must be undertaken first.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages don't last as long thanks to the underlying feeling of inner disappointment that drags down the mood of the people.
	[ICON_BULLET]Anger from using slavery to whip rush construction and training lasts significantly longer than normal due to resent by the people for being apparently so poor at getting things done that they must be pushed to such suffering.
	[ICON_BULLET]Rushing construction and training with gold costs significantly more, as the people are not capable of responding to money motivation in their demoralized state.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units are more expensive to train because you always want to make sure they have the best weaponry, even if it costs you more for ineffective gains.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]War Weariness is not as strong against your people who see war as an opportunity to take the works of others.
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy time is diminished since your bureaucrats are quick to settle on sufficient solutions to policy decisions that are as close to a copy of what others have established elsewhere as possible.

"Please don't hurt me!"
As afraid as you and your people are of being attacked, the very idea of being assaulted can invigorate them somewhat when they go on the attack. They can be like bullies that are much more confident when they are the aggressor but as soon as they come under fire, they tend to fold. This all stems from their leader having a similar mentality, who panders and blusters to avoid, at all cost, any reproach from anyone.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Assigns the Cowardly I promotion to all Combatant and Naval Combatant units. Gives a large defense penalty but a small attack bonus.
	[ICON_BULLET]Increased cost of upkeep per unit. Working for the government is perceived as carrying risk of conflict.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Decrease in the rate of earning Great Military People.
	[ICON_BULLET]Forts upgrade much slower than usual.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your workers build fort improvements much slower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Combatants and Naval Combatants lose some Experience when trained.
	[ICON_BULLET]Combatants and Naval Combatants take longer to train.
	[ICON_BULLET]Increase in War Weariness your people suffer. There is a cultural sense of terror that grips your people when at war.
	[ICON_BULLET]Decrease to the maximum number of population you convert to units during a Conscription action in a city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Lose some Free Military Units that don't require upkeep as normal that you may be getting from another source.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units are more likely to be captured when defeated. They are always looking for way they will survive being under attack.
Bonuses:
	[ICON_BULLET]Each military unit you staff in a city makes your citizens feel much safer and thus happier.
	[ICON_BULLET]Gain an additional Trade route in each city due to the economic amiability of your people so as to appease potential rivals.
	[ICON_BULLET]Decrease in the cost of upgrading units since training can only cover the bare minimums without freaking out your government employees.</English>
		<German>Negative Charaktereigenschaft
"Der Feige stirbt schon vielmal, eh' er stirbt, die Tapfern kosten einmal nur den Tod." - William Shakespeare (1564-1616)
Feige Anführer leben in ständiger Angst vor Angriffen und versuchen diese auf Biegen und Brechen zu vermeiden. Paradoxerweise führt das dazu, dass ihre Truppen tatsächlich gestärkt sind, solange sie selbst die Angreifer darstellen, in der Verteidigung aber hoffnungslos unterlegen. Sie sind ähnlich wie Raufbolde auf dem Schulhof, die nur solange stark sind, wie sie andere schikanieren können, die aber sofort einknicken, wenn sie selbst in die Schusslinie geraten.
Primäre Nachteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte laufende Kosten für militärische Einheiten (Wegen des gefürchteten Konfliktpotenzials wird der Militärdienst nur ungern verrichtet.)
Nachteile für Einheiten:
	[ICON_BULLET]alle Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten erhalten automatisch die Beförderung Feige I
Weitere Nachteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]gesenkte Geburtenrate für Große Feldherren
	[ICON_BULLET]Befestigungsanlagen im Umland werden langsamer modernisiert
	[ICON_BULLET]Arbeitstrupps bauen Befestigungsanlagen langsamer
	[ICON_BULLET]Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten erhalten beim Training weniger Erfahrungspunkte
	[ICON_BULLET]verzögertes Training für Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten
	[ICON_BULLET]Steigerung der Kriegsmüdigkeit des eigenen Volkes (Jeder Kriegszustand versetzt das Volk in Angst und Schrecken.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Verminderung der Anzahl an neuen Militäreinheiten, die über Einberufungsaktionen gewonnen werden können
	[ICON_BULLET]weniger freie Einheiten, für die keine laufenden Kosten anfallen
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte Wahrscheinlichkeit für die Gefangennahme eigener Einheiten (Überleben ist alles, was zählt.)
Vorteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte Zufriedenheit durch stationierte Militäreinheiten in Städten (da die ansässige Bevölkerung sich dadurch sicherer fühlt)
	[ICON_BULLET]eine Handelsroute mehr pro Stadt (Die Händler sind in der Lage, potenzielle Rivalen zu beschwichtigen.)

"A sucker is born every minute and I'm nobody's fool. Those who get ahead are those who take advantage of others."
There is an underlying lazy cowardliness in this leader and his people. Although they are quite aggressive at breaking down others when they can stay hidden, operating in the shadows, if attacked, they prove poor at defending themselves, tending to shrink away and flee, finding to their terror that they cannot flee from their homes without being lost forever. They pay heavy economic costs for promoting an every man for himself society.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Crime is significantly increased in your cities.
Unique Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Criminal units all gain the Crooked I Promotion, which enhances Crime Spreading and other benefits normally possessed by Criminal units.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are less happy since the good people are plagued by these thugs and hoodlums.
	[ICON_BULLET]Generic Upkeep is more expensive thanks to the coffers being commonly pilfered.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Military People are less frequent to emerge since people here are naturally inspired by their Leader to be less disciplined.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are a touch less stable on the Revolution option.
	[ICON_BULLET]Spy Type Specialists are penalized a Commerce each.
	[ICON_BULLET]Merchant Type Specialists generate one less Gold.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Law Enforcement units are trained with a few less Experience Points.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Law Enforcement units are trained significantly slower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your nation suffers more War Weariness since your Leader and his people are privately very cowardly types.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Distance to Capital is higher.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is higher.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your largest cities are less Happy since there is a reduced sense of personal security in the ghettos of the inner cities.
	[ICON_BULLET]Combat inside your borders produces a bit less Experience thanks to a lack of national pride and loyalty.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are somewhat less defensible since people here are reluctant to help take a stand in the small ways the citizenry often does.
	[ICON_BULLET]You suffer a Diplomatic penalty since other Leaders often understand your Leader is probably only looking for ways to take advantage of them for personal gain.
	[ICON_BULLET]It is moderately easier to perform Espionage Missions against your cities since information is up for sale by anyone.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities generate an additional base Culture. Creativity is stronger among those who seek ways to get the most they can for the least effort.
	[ICON_BULLET]Buildings that tend to spread Crime, even if overall more beneficial that penalizing, are constructed faster. Overall this is a benefit because it doesn't require you build them, only saves you production expense if you do.
	[ICON_BULLET]Technologies that represent advancements in Criminal thinking are faster to discover. A benefit because you do need these for later prerequisites at least.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Criminal units are trained with an additional few Experience Points.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Criminal units are trained significantly faster.</English>

"Victory rarely goes to the aggressor, but rather to the prepared."
The best thing you can do with this leader is let your foes attack you and blunt their teeth against your thick hide.

		<German>Positive Charaktereigenschaft
"Wer auf den Krieg vorbereitet ist, kann den Frieden am besten wahren." - George Washington (1732-1799)
Ein defensiver Anführer igelt sich am liebsten ein und lässt seine Feinde von seiner starken Verteidigung dezimieren. Wenn er Engpässe besetzen kann, dann gibt es für gegnerische Einheiten nahezu kein Durchkommen mehr. Wer gegen einen defensiven Anführer in den Krieg zieht, der sollte sich auf Materialschlachten einstellen und bereit sein, einen hohen Blutzoll zu entrichten.
Primäre Vorteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]reduzierte laufende Kosten für militärische Einheiten
Vorteile für Einheiten:
	[ICON_BULLET]alle Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten erhalten automatisch die Beförderung Defensiv I
Weitere Vorteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte Geburtenrate für Große Feldherren
	[ICON_BULLET]Befestigungsanlagen im Umland werden schneller modernisiert
	[ICON_BULLET]Arbeitstrupps bauen Befestigungsanlagen schneller
	[ICON_BULLET]als angesiedelte Spezialisten bringen Große Feldherren zusätzlich [ICON_COMMERCE]
	[ICON_BULLET]Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten erhalten beim Training zusätzliche Erfahrungspunkte
	[ICON_BULLET]beschleunigtes Training für Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten
	[ICON_BULLET]Verminderung der Kriegsmüdigkeit des eigenen Volkes
	[ICON_BULLET]Erhöhung der Anzahl an neuen Militäreinheiten, die über Einberufungsaktionen gewonnen werden können
	[ICON_BULLET]zusätzliche freie Einheiten, für die keine laufenden Kosten anfallen
	[ICON_BULLET]verringerte Wahrscheinlichkeit für die Gefangennahme eigener Einheiten
Nachteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]eine Handelsroute weniger pro Stadt (durch die erhöhten Sicherheitsvorkehrungen)
	[ICON_BULLET]Verminderung der Kriegsmüdigkeit der gegnerischen Bevölkerung (Niemand rechnet mit Gegenangriffen.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Preisanstieg für die Modernisierung von Einheiten (Ausgefeilte Verteidigungstaktiken zu erlernen, hat seinen Preis.)
	[ICON_BULLET]verringerte Wahrscheinlichkeit für die Gefangennahme gegnerischer Einheiten (Die eigenen Truppen lassen sich nicht auf die Verfolgung Besiegter ein.)</German>

"Wer auf den Krieg vorbereitet ist, kann den Frieden am besten wahren." - George Washington (1732-1799)
Ein defensiver Anführer igelt sich am liebsten ein und lässt seine Feinde von seiner starken Verteidigung dezimieren. Wenn er Engpässe besetzen kann, dann gibt es für gegnerische Einheiten nahezu kein Durchkommen mehr. Wer gegen einen defensiven Anführer in den Krieg zieht, der sollte sich auf Materialschlachten einstellen und bereit sein, einen hohen Blutzoll zu entrichten.

		<Russian>Positive Trait
'Victory rarely goes to the aggressor, but rather to the prepared.'
The best thing you can do with this leader is let your foes attack you and blunt their teeth against your thick hide.

I have many plans and goals and all of them build onto one another, are interconnected. So many working parts and I keep them all spinning. I WILL leave a legacy!"
The goal of this leader is for he and his people to leave behind as incredible a legacy as possible in the amount of time he has to achieve it. He pushes his people hard to find great accomplishments but cuts some corners on some things to achieve this, like trade investments.

Unique Benefits:

He pushes his people hard to find great accomplishments but cuts some corners on some things to achieve this, like trade investments. Any buildings and techs that increase productivity are faster to come together as they get higher priority resources. Units are trained with a little less quality.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]World Wonders, National Wonders, and Team Projects are constructed significantly faster than usual.
	[ICON_BULLET]Rushing construction and training costs much less than normal.
Unique Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Buildings that speed up construction and training are constructed faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]Techs that give benefits for being first to research them are discovered faster.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy periods don't last nearly as long because your Leader more rapidly addresses the problems with new policy shifts.
	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements naturally upgrade twice as fast.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers are much faster than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your people are more efficient at their jobs and thus you gain a Free Specialist in all cities to represent that added amount of labor.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military Units are significantly faster to train due to streamlined training regimens.
	[ICON_BULLET]The people are faster to forgive whipping to rush construction and training.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units are significantly cheaper to upgrade since they are faster to learn new ways to fight.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Trade Route profits are reduced for Production yields.
	[ICON_BULLET]This nation suffers significantly more from War Weariness since war slows down development projects and enhances achievement stress.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units begin with one less Experience Point due to streamlined training procedures.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your nation naturally supports a reduced amount of Free Units based on a small percentage of the overall total population.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are harder to defend since they are built for efficiency rather than holding invaders out.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages don't last as long because people get back to a sense of normal faster.

"Faith will not help us. It's just us against the world so we must stay very serious about this struggle and never give in to fantasy or imagined glory."
This dour downer tends to depress his nation but at least his people know he's taking things seriously. Pride is considered a dangerous thing to maintain here so morale can suffer in a number of ways and religion is not as valued, and for many is deeply resented, as it cannot be empirically proven so appears tremendously foolish to a good portion of the populace, who have adopted the views of their leader.
Primary Penalties:

	[ICON_BULLET]Commerce benefits from being in a Golden Age are significantly decreased.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages last far fewer rounds.

	[ICON_BULLET]Buildings take longer to construct where the state religion has spread.
	[ICON_BULLET]Using slavery to rush builds results in greater lengths of city unhappiness as people resent being asked to push even harder than they already must.

	[ICON_BULLET]The value of labor is high here so you get a Free Specialist in each city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your people gain an Education bonus since nothing is glossed over for the sake of protecting innocence.</English>

"This is a harsh world. Raising children in this environment is a major risk to the community even if it is necessary to our future. Aside from it being quite possible to end up with too many mouths to feed, we can also quickly end up with too many voices to contend with. I urge restraint so that we may provide for those in our care while retaining as much focus on more important matters as we can. It is THIS generation that is my concern, much moreso than the next."
This Leader is worried that if his people overgrow their infrastructure to support them that he will be faced with starvation and be saddled with added expenses to the nation's coffers. He therefore promotes smaller families that wait to grow until they are financially secure and well prepared to support their kids. It may not be unwise, but it does impede population expansion and ultimately the strength of the nation.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a percentage penalty to Food and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Cities require a little more food to grow.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities are less happy with this dour outlook.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great People are born slower here due to the expressed lack of confidence in people to provide and excel.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities all produce one less base Food and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]War Weariness accumulates faster since your people invest more into their young and feel they have less people to sacrifice to a war.
	[ICON_BULLET]You get fewer citizens drafted with each conscription action in a city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Distance to City is enhanced due to greater investments into more vulnerable regions.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is increased since your Leader tends to overspend to insure additional communities against fears for their well-being.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military units are trained somewhat slower since there is a reluctance among families to allow their children to enlist.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages don't last as long thanks to the more serious outlook people take here tending to dampen spirits.
	[ICON_BULLET]Anger for rushing construction and training lasts longer here since life is held at a high value.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units you defeat are somewhat less likely to be captured because of concerns of bringing potential enemies home.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units are more likely to be captured when defeated because they have been taught to value self preservation.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Generals emerge a little faster since it is of the utmost importance that militaries from smaller populations are led more effectively.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities generate an extra base Gold.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities all gain a percentage modifier to Gold.
	[ICON_BULLET]Citizen and Slave type Specialists work harder to produce for their employers since there are fewer of them to go around, so earn an extra Gold each.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities have slightly improved defenses thanks to your added investments into their safety.</English>

"One is judged by the integrity of their word. The state needs to be upfront and share our knowledge with the people."
Some may question whether an honest, forthright, straightforward Leader is a wise one. But this Leader knows how to use his honesty in a manner that serves him, proverbially throwing himself on his sword when necessary to prove the point that he will always be open with people, even when it would be more convenient not to be. He's not all that great with Espionage, rather his people aren't thanks to not being quite as clever as their Leader when adopting him as a role-model. He is well loved by all and his policy of truth pays off with many dividends in trade and diplomacy, most powerfully to strongly motivate his people when he can clearly show that the nation is on the right track. He is no fool and is not hobbled strategically by his nature. He may be honest, but he also knows how to time the release of information in the most effective manner possible. More often, his tactic to achieve this strategy is to avoid having things to hide in the first place.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your people are significantly easier to Educate.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages are significantly more profitable for all Yields.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages are significantly more profitable for all Commerces.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all happier, able to believe their Leader.
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy periods are reduced.
	[ICON_BULLET]All of your cities gain an additional trade route. Merchants love the straightforward deals they get here.
	[ICON_BULLET]You gain a Diplomatic bonus since other Leaders feel they can take you at your word.
	[ICON_BULLET]Foreign Trade Routes are more profitable since your people's fair dealings lead to improved results with foreign businessmen who are normally reluctant to trust.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are significantly easier to perform Espionage Missions in.
	[ICON_BULLET]The length of Golden Ages is significantly reduced since your society takes so much advantage of the time they have in their exuberance.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your people take significantly longer to forgive being whipped to rush construction and training projects.
	[ICON_BULLET]All non-state religions are significantly harder to spread.</English>

"All ideas should be heard and respected. I judge all things down the middle of any disagreement to make the best determinations."
This leader enjoys a nation that is very productive in gold, espionage, food and production. His people don't seek glory, which is as helpful with diplomacy. In fact, this is one of the most beneficial traits for working with other leaders.

	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer a little less from Crime since egotism drives a lot of criminal behavior and that isn't as problematic here.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Great People are a little slower to be born since achieving greatness is not highly important to people who see their leader as a role model.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Military People don't emerge quite as fast since competitive dominance is not a supported value here.
	[ICON_BULLET]World Wonders take longer to build because the nation doesn't feel it has anything to prove.
	[ICON_BULLET]Anarchy time when changing Civics is significantly longer since all voices in the policy discussion are heard and decisions aren't made until solutions all sides can settle on are found.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military units take longer to train since the warrior's natural competitiveness is a rare personality to find here.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units are more easily captured when defeated because they don't see surrender as a strike against their pride.</English>

"The time taken to plan carefully is the time in which you lose the initiative. Act now or lose out! Sure it leads to lots of mistakes but its better than sitting still!"
Gains a highly lubricated government. Low upkeep and faster results. Leader and his followers are not as mentally agile so since war is chaotic it is irritating to the habit driven people, and it takes longer to reorganize the government properly after a change in policies.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Overall Upkeep is increased tremendously.
	[ICON_BULLET]All specialists lose a Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Distance to Capital is tremendously increased.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is hugely increased.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements naturally upgrade far slower since your people demand work crews come and get them upgraded immediately whenever an upgrade is available.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers are much slower since they tend to start projects without plans and make a lot of time costly mistakes.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units start with one less Experience point since your leader is impatient to get them out of training.
	[ICON_BULLET]You lose a number of Free Units if you were getting any.
	[ICON_BULLET]You suffer a penalty to the number of Free Units you get based on a small percentage of your overall population.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your largest cities are less happy thanks to sloppy urban planning making life harder on folks.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military Units are slower to train because training curricula are whatever the trainers feel like that day.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]It takes a bit less experience for your units to level and thus gain promotions.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Military People are slightly faster to emerge since your people find it natural to jump into leadership roles.
	[ICON_BULLET]Artist and Slave type Specialists are more freely creative and thus give an additional Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy time is shorter since your Leader is impatient to implement new policies.</English>

"What they don't know won't hurt you."
Your Leader really doesn't care if people trust him or not. If he has something to hide, he'll do his best to hide it. Unfortunately, he's not all that good at it and frequently gets caught lying and bragging and making up alternative facts. Other nations don't trust him, nor do they trust your people, and it costs you in trade and diplomacy. When things are going well, it's often more that your Leader is playing a political maneuver to make people THINK things are prosperous, and as a result, when things SHOULD be great, they are a little lackluster under the surface. People are often misinformed and undereducated here, but at least all that confusion makes it harder for your opponents to get any reliable intel from your people.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your people are significantly more difficult to Educate.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages are significantly less profitable for all Yields.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages are significantly less profitable for all Commerces.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all more unhappy, frustrated with frequently finding out they believed in a falsehood.
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy periods are increased.
	[ICON_BULLET]All of your cities lose a trade route. Merchants resent the underhanded dealing they encounter here.
	[ICON_BULLET]You gain a Diplomatic penalty since other Leaders can see your Leader speaks from both sides of his mouth.
	[ICON_BULLET]Foreign Trade Routes are less profitable since your people's scams reduce the willingness of foreign merchants to engage in fair dealings with them.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are significantly harder to perform Espionage Missions in.
	[ICON_BULLET]The length of Golden Ages is significantly increased since your Leaders lofty claims keeps people thinking the nation is prospering even when it isn't.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your people take significantly less time to forgive being whipped to rush construction and training projects. They are used to being deeply disappointed in their Leader.
	[ICON_BULLET]Non-State religions are significantly easier to spread.</English>

		<English>Positive Trait
"A sick society is doomed to fail. Diseases, not other nations, are humanity's greatest threat and the role of government is to protect the people from their greatest threats"
Extremely good at combating disease. Most people in this nation are as fascinated by medicine as the Leader is. Problem is, providing such excellent care and subsidizing medical research is expensive for the nation. But people are a bit more productive, being sick less often, and its easier to find healthy recruits for the military when you've been keeping them healthy all their lives. The nation doesn't weary of war quite so quickly when they feel confident their loved ones will be well cared for if injured.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]You enter a Golden Age whenever a Great Doctor is born in your nation.
	[ICON_BULLET]Disease is significantly reduced in all cities.
Unique Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Healer units all gain the Medical I Promotion, which enhances Healing benefits a bit and reduces Disease locally by a lot.

"It is absolutely immoral and dangerous to go invading other nations. Large nations are far too much work anyhow! Count me out of ever taking part in such an effort."
Meek leaders are better off planning to avoid having to invade. They are better off growing larger, fewer cities. It might be costly for them to maintain large empires but if they can peacefully outgrow their rivals and never have to take ground by force, they can overcome their weaknesses.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Applies the Meek I promotion to all Combatant units. Strong city attack penalty and a reduction in the ability to aid stability in the city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military units cost even more gold to upkeep.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities construct Siege based and Siege supporting buildings slower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Techs that support and unlock Siege units are slower to research.
	[ICON_BULLET]Siege units lose experience when trained.
	[ICON_BULLET]Siege units are slower to train.
	[ICON_BULLET]Slight decrease to the maximum number of population you convert to units during a Conscription action in a city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Higher Maintenance costs from Distance to Capital. Planning to conquer so much territory, your people are more efficient at maintaining larger empires with larger areas.
	[ICON_BULLET]Higher Maintenance costs from Number of Cities.
	[ICON_BULLET]Lose an amount of Free Units based on a small percentage of the total population of your nation.
	[ICON_BULLET]Lose an amount of Free Military Units based on a small percentage of the total population of your nation.
	[ICON_BULLET]Enemies suffer less War Weariness since they do not fear losing their cities to your forces.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units are slightly less likely to capture defeated enemy units since they lack a dominant mindset and often allow those retreating to escape.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units are more likely to be captured when defeated because they will more readily submit to their foes.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Reduction in overall upkeep costs.
	[ICON_BULLET]Slightly enhanced rate of birthing Great People as autonomy, both personal and national, is respected here.
	[ICON_BULLET]Gain a diplomatic bonus since leaders comfortably believe you won't invade them.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units are slightly cheaper to upgrade because city invasion training is not part of their curriculum.
	[ICON_BULLET]Crime is reduced since the people value the personal freedoms they have.</English>

		<Russian>Negative Trait
'It is absolutely immoral and dangerous to go invading other nations. Large nations are far too much work anyhow! Count me out of ever taking part in such an effort.'
Meek leaders are better off planning to avoid having to invade. They are better off growing larger, fewer cities. It might be costly for them to maintain large empires but if they can peacefully outgrow their rivals and never have to take ground by force, they can overcome their weaknesses.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Applies the Meek III promotion to all Combatant units. Strong city attack penalty and a reduction in the ability to aid stability in the city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military units cost even more gold to upkeep.
Side Penalties:

	[ICON_BULLET]Techs that support and unlock Siege units are slower to research.
	[ICON_BULLET]Siege units lose experience when trained.

"Large nations are impossible to manage. Better to have a small, compact one that can be kept under close wraps."
It might be possible that with the Win for Losing game option on, this may actually be closer to a positive trait than a negative one, despite being primarily Negative in modifiers. This leader would prefer to focus on managing a small nation well than trying much to build out that nation and expand it into an empire. It will take you a lot more effort to tame your lands. The people are slower to grow and expand and if you are too effective at it, you'll be saddled with huge expenses for doing so. However, you do benefit from people that are better at focusing on the problems they face and finding solutions to them, and on wondrous works.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer from a percentage penalty to Food and Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]Settlers are trained much slower than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers are trained much slower than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements organically upgrade incredibly slower than usual, if at all.
	[ICON_BULLET]Workers are far slower at improving your territory.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolutions option, instability from the distance to capital is increased.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities all generate one less base Food and Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]Upkeep from Distance to Capital is moderately increased.
	[ICON_BULLET]Upkeep from Number of Cities is moderately increased.
	[ICON_BULLET]You get penalized an amount of Free Units derived from a small percentage of your overall Population.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Largest Cities are less happy since your citizens feel burdened in highly populated areas.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Military Units are a little slower to be trained since your people are in no hurry.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]World Wonders are constructed faster than normal since these large projects represent highly focused local efforts.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all given an additional base Research.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities all benefit from a percentage modifier to Research.
	[ICON_BULLET]Scientist and Doctor type Specialists take their time in patient studies and thus add a Research each.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are a little more defensible because your cities are constructed with patient care.</English>

While you are a clever leader who often misdirects his foes into strategic traps, and your spies are top notch, your people don't appreciate being lied to and being subject to intrusive investigations. Other nations are particularly suspicious of you and your people.

		<English>Positive Trait
"Walk gently upon Mother Earth for our health is hers. I will not tolerate a messy society that disposes of its wastes haphazardly. We have enough to worry about without poisoning ourselves in the process of achieving our goals."
Although the benefits from this trait may not be as strong for your nation in the immediate beginning of the game, being able to hit the mid-game developments without having pollution going out of control would be quite a benefit. Pollution is normally very difficult, if not impossible, to fully manage throughout certain eras, and perhaps no property can create as crippling an impact as pollution. Besides, respect for your environment pays off with happier and healthier people all throughout the game. You may see a little reduced Production but you can make up for it with creative solutions and your people know how to nurture the land so can produce a lot more food. Your people don't produce as many things for sale since they try not to take so much from the land, so Commerce is impacted some. But if you can make this trait work for you, you should feel good about yourself and your nation, for while many real cultures have attempted to possess this outlook, unfortunately many proved to lack the aggression necessary to survive the test of time. Yet today, we turn to their ways and wish greatly that we had been adopting them ourselves all along. And perhaps we will really lament not adopting these views much earlier.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities benefit from less Air Pollution.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities benefit from less Water Pollution.
Unique Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All your units gain the Naturalist I Promotion, which makes all your units perform cleanup tasks in their downtime, therefore causing them to reduce both water and air pollution a little each.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all healthier.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all happier.
	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements that represent green power and revitalizing the land are built faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]Artist Type Specialists gain an additional Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest Type Specialists gain an additional Research.
	[ICON_BULLET]Celebrity and Artist Type Specialists gain an additional Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your workers are more effective at working with the land rather than against it and thus complete their builds significantly faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Largest cities are Happier since community cleanup efforts are stronger where there are more citizens there to chip in and usually big cities are festering in garbage - not here!
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Generic Upkeep is higher since being responsible with industry is expensive.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer from one less base Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a small percentage penalty to Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is higher since patrols do regular garbage collections.
	[ICON_BULLET]Corporations are more expensive to operate under stiff emissions and waste regulations.
	[ICON_BULLET]The expense of rushing constructions and training is higher when your industries refuse to cut corners on cleanup.
	[ICON_BULLET]Access to Whales, Fur, and Lead all generate an unhappiness each since they all arouse the ire of your citizens.</English>

But if you can make this trait work for you, you should feel good about yourself and your nation, for while many real cultures have attempted to possess this outlook, unfortunately many proved to lack the aggression necessary to survive the test of time. Yet today, we turn to their ways and wish greatly that we had been adopting them ourselves all along. And perhaps we will really lament not adopting these views much earlier.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All specialists produce an extra Food.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities benefit from significantly less Air Pollution.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities benefit from significantly less Water Pollution.
Unique Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All your units gain the Naturalist III Promotion, which makes all your units perform cleanup tasks in their downtime, therefore causing them to reduce both water and air pollution a little each.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all healthier.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all happier.
	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements that represent forest planting naturally upgrade far faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]Improvements that represent green power and revitalizing the land are built faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your workers are more effective at working with the land rather than against it and thus complete their builds significantly faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Largest cities are Happier since community cleanup efforts are stronger where there are more citizens there to chip in and usually big cities are festering in garbage - not here!
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Generic Upkeep is higher since being responsible with industry is expensive.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a percentage penalty to Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is higher since patrols do regular garbage collections.
	[ICON_BULLET]Corporations are more expensive to operate under stiff emissions and waste regulations.
	[ICON_BULLET]The expense of rushing constructions and training is significantly higher when your industries refuse to cut corners on cleanup.</English>
		<Russian>Positive Trait
'Walk gently upon Mother Earth for our health is hers. I will not tolerate a messy society that disposes of its wastes haphazardly. We have enough to worry about without poisoning ourselves in the process of achieving our goals.'
Although the benefits from this trait may not be as strong for your nation in the immediate beginning of the game, being able to hit the mid-game developments without having pollution going out of control would be quite a benefit. Pollution is normally very difficult, if not impossible, to fully manage throughout certain eras, and perhaps no property can create as crippling an impact as pollution. Besides, respect for your environment pays off with happier and healthier people all throughout the game. You may see a little reduced Production but you can make up for it with creative solutions and your people know how to nurture the land so can produce a lot more food.

		<English>Negative Trait
"I really doubt anyone will ever wish to take MY cities. If they do I'll just take them back. Why build fortifications? Isn't that just going to make recapturing my cities even harder?"
If you don't like worrying too much about holding your cities and would prefer to just protect them to a minimum and retaliate later if your opponents start capturing them, this is the Negative Trait of choice for you. Your people lack for caution but this leads to frazzled nerves for some.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Applies the Negligent I promotion to all Combatant units. Strong city defense penalty and an additional side penalty.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer a penalty to base defensive modifier due to complex strategic preparations always established and in place.
	[ICON_BULLET]Defenses in your cities are easier to diminish with bombardments.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Penalty to happiness in every city. Some just cannot handle the flippant state attitude about defense.
	[ICON_BULLET]Significant penalty to earning Great Military People when combat takes place inside your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities construct Defensive buildings slower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Techs that form prerequisites for Defensive buildings are slower to discover.
	[ICON_BULLET]Decrease to the maximum number of population you convert to units during a Conscription action in a city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Lose an amount of Free Military Units based on the total population of your nation.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units gain significantly less experience when the battle takes place within your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]It is easier for your opponents to perform espionage missions against you.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages are somewhat more beneficial in terms of yields.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages are a little more beneficial in terms of commerces.
	[ICON_BULLET]Decrease in the amount of War Weariness you suffer. Most people are prepared for dealing with living under a new flag for a while but trust responses will be forthcoming.
	[ICON_BULLET]Lower Maintenance costs from Distance to Capital. Much of the upkeep costs for this were based on establishing defensive routes and plans and trained responses, all dismissed under this leadership.
	[ICON_BULLET]Lower Maintenance costs from Number of Cities. So much easier to get around the costs of defensive planning for lots of cities when you just don't bother with those plans.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages are longer. You and your people live as carefree as possible and take revelry farther than some societies would.</English>

	[ICON_BULLET]Techs that form prerequisites for Defensive buildings are slower to discover.
	[ICON_BULLET]Decrease to the maximum number of population you convert to units during a Conscription action in a city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Lose an amount of Free Military Units based on the total population of your nation.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units gain significantly less experience when the battle takes place within your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]It is easier for your opponents to perform espionage missions against you.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages are more beneficial in terms of yields.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages are more beneficial in terms of commerces.
	[ICON_BULLET]Decrease in the amount of War Weariness you suffer. Most people are prepared for dealing with living under a new flag for a while but trust responses will be forthcoming.
	[ICON_BULLET]Much lower Maintenance costs from Distance to Capital. Much of the upkeep costs for this were based on establishing defensive routes and plans and trained responses, all dismissed under this leadership.
	[ICON_BULLET]Far lower Maintenance costs from Number of Cities. So much easier to get around the costs of defensive planning for lots of cities when you just don't bother with those plans.

		<English>Positive Trait
"Through trade and negotiation comes the leverage for world dominance."
This leader knows how to win friends and influence people and the public learns by his example. This makes trade and tourism your forte, as well as diplomacy and politics. War really isn't your 'thing' much since you usually find more cooperative ways to address matters rather than direct conflict.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All Trade Routes are significantly more productive with yields generated.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities may maintain an additional Trade Route than the normal limit.
	[ICON_BULLET]All Foreign Trade Routes are even more productive with yields generated.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Merchant Type Specialists generate an additional Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Trade Units are trained with a bonus Experience Point.
	[ICON_BULLET]Trade Units are trained faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic changes cause slightly fewer rounds of Anarchy.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Distance to Capital is reduced since your people are fast and effective at shipping and trade.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from the Number of Cities is reduced since you are able to use your diplomatic talents to keep other cities more self-sustaining with less funding from the national coffers.
	[ICON_BULLET]All your cities gain an additional Trade Route.
	[ICON_BULLET]You gain a Diplomatic bonus with other Leaders. They like working with someone who quickly finds strong cooperative solutions.
	[ICON_BULLET]Gains additional Tourism in all your cities.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Generals are a little slower to emerge since the military is not a heavily relied on bargaining point.
	[ICON_BULLET]War Weariness accumulates faster since war interrupts trade routes.
	[ICON_BULLET]One less citizen may be drafted during a conscription action.
	[ICON_BULLET]Cities are less defensible since they are built more for effective routing of travel than for defense.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military units are trained slower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are easier to perform Espionage Missions in for your enemies. Your people are a talkative bunch.</English>

"War? What's it good for? Absolutely nothing!"
This leader resents conflict and tends to live in denial that it can occasionally be necessary, or a key to achievement. He, and his people, focus more on other priorities and tend to leave themselves vulnerable as a result.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Reduction of any available Free Military units from a penalty based on the total amount of your overall population.
	[ICON_BULLET]Huge Increase in War Weariness you suffer. Your people are not merely fearful of war, but object to it as a solution.
	[ICON_BULLET]Strong Reduction in the speed of training all Military units. Your people object to becoming soldiers in any capacity.
	[ICON_BULLET]Strong Increase in the price to upgrade your units.
Unique Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Applies Pacifist I Promotion to all Combatant units. Pacifist I is a fairly basic promotion with a relatively minor -10% combat modifier.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Improved relations with opponent leaders. They like pushovers they need not fear.
	[ICON_BULLET]Moderate Education bonus. The people are more focused on developing knowledge rather than on military strategy and physical prowess.
	[ICON_BULLET]Minor Happiness bonus. People are more cooperative and engaging with one another and are more content with life as a result.</English>
		<German>Negative Charaktereigenschaft
"Ich glaube an die Gewaltlosigkeit als einziges Heilmittel." - Mohandas Karamchand (genannt Mahatma) Gandhi (1869-1948)

Da der Anführer und sein Volk andere Prioritäten haben, vernachlässigen sie Militär und Verteidigung, was sie zu leichten Opfern für mächtige Aggressoren macht.
Primäre Nachteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]Verminderung aller freien Militäreinheiten basierend auf der Gesamtbevölkerung
	[ICON_BULLET]Steigerung der Kriegsmüdigkeit des eigenen Volkes (Die Bevölkerung fürchtet den Krieg nicht nur, es hält ihn außerdem für sinnlos.)
	[ICON_BULLET]verlangsamte Ausbildung von Militäreinheiten (Es besteht im Volk keinerlei Interesse am Soldatenhandwerk.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Preisanstieg für die Modernisierung von Einheiten

	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhter Bildungsstand (Das Volk konzentriert sich mehr auf das Lernen und Forschen als auf militärische Ausbildung und Körperertüchtigung.)
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte Gesundheit (Das Volk lebt sicherer. Es kommt nur selten zu Raufereien und Streitigkeiten.)
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte Zufriedenheit (Deine Leute arbeiten eher mit- als gegeneinander und sind deshalb zufriedener mit ihrem Leben.)</German>
		<Russian>Negative Trait
'War? What's it good for? Absolutely nothing!'
This leader resents conflict and tends to live in denial that it can occasionally be necessary, or a key to achievement. He, and his people, focus more on other priorities and tend to leave themselves vulnerable as a result.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Huge Increase in War Weariness you suffer. Your people are not merely fearful of war, but object to it as a solution.
	[ICON_BULLET]Reduction of any available Free Military units from a penalty based on the total amount of your overall population.
	[ICON_BULLET]Huge reduction in the speed of training all Military units. Your people object to becoming soldiers in any capacity.
	[ICON_BULLET]Huge increase in the price to upgrade your units.
Unique Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Applies Pacifist II Promotion to all Combatant units. Pacifist II is a fairly basic promotion with a relatively minor -10% combat modifier.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Reduced rate of earning Great Military People.
	[ICON_BULLET]Small reduction to the maximum number of population you convert to units during a Conscription action in a city.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Reduction in overall upkeep due to a diminished focus on military training and quality assurance of national defense.
	[ICON_BULLET]Moderate Education bonus. The people are more focused on developing knowledge rather than on military strategy and physical prowess.
	[ICON_BULLET]Minor Health bonus. People tend to live safer lives with fights and conflict being infrequent.
	[ICON_BULLET]Minor Happiness Penalty. People are more cooperative and engaging with one another and are more content with life as a result.</Russian>

		<German>Negative Charaktereigenschaft
"Ich glaube an die Gewaltlosigkeit als einziges Heilmittel." - Mohandas Karamchand (genannt Mahatma) Gandhi (1869-1948)
Das Staatsoberhaupt hasst Konflikte jeglicher Art. Es vertritt die Meinung, dass Kriege absolut unnötig sind und es keinerlei Grund für die Anwendung von Gewalt gibt. Da der Anführer und sein Volk andere Prioritäten haben, vernachlässigen sie Militär und Verteidigung, was sie zu leichten Opfern für mächtige Aggressoren macht.
Primäre Nachteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]Steigerung der Kriegsmüdigkeit des eigenen Volkes (Die Bevölkerung fürchtet den Krieg nicht nur, es hält ihn außerdem für sinnlos.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Verminderung aller freien Militäreinheiten basierend auf der Gesamtbevölkerung
	[ICON_BULLET]verlangsamte Ausbildung von Militäreinheiten (Es besteht im Volk keinerlei Interesse am Soldatenhandwerk.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Preisanstieg für die Modernisierung von Einheiten
Einschränkungen für Einheiten:

		<English>Positive Trait
"A man who stands for nothing falls for anything. If you believe in a Religion, you MUST live what you believe, or you actually don't believe it at all. Devotion to a faith, mind, body, and soul, is the only way to find meaning in your life."
When you adopt a religion, you adopt it fully. It's not about hating rival faiths but about living the belief to the letter. That said, other faiths DO make everyone here very uncomfortable and it becomes state policy to dissuade them and run them off if the speak too loudly. You and your people enjoy incredible gifts where your state religion is spread, all the moreso if you own the Holy City for that religion.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Units are faster to train where you have your state religion.
	[ICON_BULLET]Buildings are faster to construct where you have your state religion.
	[ICON_BULLET]Gain a significant Experience point modifier boost in the Holy City of your state religion.
	[ICON_BULLET]Allows the nation to produce Inquisitor units once technologically unlocked, that can remove all religions but the state religion in a city.
Abilities:
	[ICON_BULLET]All combat capable units gain the Devotion I Promotion, which gives a strong religious combat modifier, which is a combat modifier that applies as a benefit to your unit if the opponent unit is not of your religion, but as a penalty if they are.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolutions Option, cities are more stable with your religion.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest type City Specialists give an additional Production yield.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest type City Specialists give an additional Gold and Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]War Weariness is diminished due to strong faith that a higher power should favor them due to their devotion.
	[ICON_BULLET]Gains a significant bonus to the rate of birthing Great People wherever your state religion has spread.
	[ICON_BULLET]Cities with your state religion are happier.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units trained in cities with your state religion gain a few extra base free Experience points.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your state religion is easier to spread.
	[ICON_BULLET]Gain a happiness wherever you have access to the Incense resource.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolutions Option, cities are less stable with multiple religions present.
	[ICON_BULLET]A small overall Gold percent penalty in all cities. Even the government donates a percentage to the Church.
	[ICON_BULLET]Religious and spiritual technologies are discovered slower. The dedication to the faith the people have blinds them to new religious thought.
	[ICON_BULLET]Each non-state Religion in a city makes the city less happy.
	[ICON_BULLET]War Weariness accumulates slower for your foes because they may tend to see your society as a threat to their views so are invigorated to battle you.
	[ICON_BULLET]Lose a small amount of free experience on units trained in Holy Cities of non-state religions.
	[ICON_BULLET]Non-state religions are more difficult to spread.</English>

		<English>Positive Trait
"A man who stands for nothing falls for anything. If you believe in a Religion, you MUST live what you believe, or you actually don't believe it at all. Devotion to a faith, mind, body, and soul, is the only way to find meaning in your life."
When you adopt a religion, you adopt it fully. It's not about hating rival faiths but about living the belief to the letter. That said, other faiths DO make everyone here very uncomfortable and it becomes state policy to dissuade them and run them off if the speak too loudly. You and your people enjoy incredible gifts where your state religion is spread, all the moreso if you own the Holy City for that religion.

Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolutions Option, cities are more stable with your religion.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest type City Specialists give an additional Production yield.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest type City Specialists give an additional Gold, Research, Espionage AND Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]War Weariness is diminished due to strong faith that a higher power should favor them due to their devotion.

"People are counting on their leaders to do things right. That requires the ability to make the tough choices and to always be willing to look your real challenges right in the face without a shred of denial. Take them head on and don't pussyfoot around the fact that there will always be wolves nipping at the heels of your society. Stay away from the indulgences that plague others."
This leader gets a percent bonus to all Commerces and Yields, the primary properties, Crime, Disease, and Education, are all improved, and there are some simple but effective military benefits, making this trait a solid selection for nearly any strategy or playstyle. However, there are some added expenses and delays and this trait gives the most direct and the strongest total happiness penalties among all positive traits. Nevertheless, for the Pragmatic player, this can be a good, no-frills, no bells and whistles, simple generic choice.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Cities all gain a minor percentage modifier to Food, Production, and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Cities all gain a minor percentage modifier to Gold, Research, Culture, and Espionage.

	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities enjoy a little less Crime.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities enjoy a little less Disease.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities benefit from a touch more Education.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all less happy since the leader does not sugarcoat the problems the nation faces and pushes his nation to achieve as much as it possibly can despite the stress it causes.
	[ICON_BULLET]Overall Upkeep is higher because this leader overlooks nothing and spends everything he must to get the best out of his nation.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Distance to Capital is higher.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is higher.
	[ICON_BULLET]Corporation Maintenance is higher.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your largest cities are less happy because you put a lot of strain on your strongest centers of activity to perform.

		<English>Positive Trait
"Power starts at the center of the government and extends outwards. That which is closest to the source is the most nurtured."
Both political and religious centers of power are highly favored in this leader's preferences for funding and attention. He tends to let the exterior and less magnificent cities go underfunded and they actually end up costing more as a result. Those citizens who closest to these seats of power have stronger national pride and a fervor to protect the crown. A good trait for a super-city player.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]The Capital produces more Food, Production and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]The Capital produces more Gold, Research, Culture and Espionage.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units trained in the capital get significantly more bonus Experience Points than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units Trained in the Holy City of your State Religion gain significantly more bonus Experience Points than normal.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Military People are generated faster from battles inside your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]National Wonders are constructed faster in your cities.
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolution option, Holy City instability is diminished.
	[ICON_BULLET]Administrative and National Pride Buildings are faster to construct.
	[ICON_BULLET]Administrative and National Pride Buildings generate extra happiness in your cities.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units gain more experience from combat within your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]Holy Cities of Non-State religions produce units with a bonus to Experience Points.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolution option, distance plays a larger role in creating instability.
	[ICON_BULLET]You suffer a significant increase in Maintenance from Distance to Capital due to underfunding allowing problems needing attention to exacerbate.
	[ICON_BULLET]You suffer a significant increase in the Maintenance from Number of Cities since you resent having to fund any cities that aren't of key importance and thus allows expenses to build to critical levels.
	[ICON_BULLET]Get one less trade route in every city since your citizens even tend to only recognize the most influential cities of the world as being on their own radar for trade.
	[ICON_BULLET]Foreign trade routes are less productive since your people are less interested in what happens outside their borders.</English>

Both political and religious centers of power are highly favored in this leader's preferences for funding and attention. He tends to let the exterior and less magnificent cities go underfunded and they actually end up costing more as a result. Those citizens who closest to these seats of power have stronger national pride and a fervor to protect the crown. A good trait for a super-city player.

		<English>Positive Trait
"Human rights and dignities are the most important thing to expand upon and protect."
Far from a basket of deplorables, you and your people are engaged social activists and civil rights warriors. You do all you can to ensure fair treatment in this system and you benefit from some very unique and uncommon game effects in the process. However, it is heavily advised to never whip your slaves. Your people have no tolerance for mistreatment of anyone. Slavery itself is not particularly penalized because as long as you treat people well, it's understood to just be another station in society. War should be avoided if possible and as conscientious objectors, your people are reluctant to enter into military service. Your Leader also believes that all religions should be capable of tolerating one another and should be able to bring their own unique benefits to their diverse society without bias. The benefits in this trait are so unusual and potent that there are no Primary and Secondary Benefits here, just Benefits.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]The presence of any religion gives a base benefit in yields, commerce and happiness regardless of if they are your state religion or not.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages are much longer than normal here since people so greatly rejoice in the strength of their diversity.
	[ICON_BULLET]Cities require less food to grow.
	[ICON_BULLET]You get a Free Specialist for each National Wonder in your city.
	[ICON_BULLET]All religions are active in your nation on the Religious Disabling option.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities enjoy a reduction in Crime.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities enjoy a reduction in Disease.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities enjoy an increase in Education.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Basic Upkeep is slightly more expensive. New progressive programs are consistently attempted and are often more costly than they prove beneficial.
	[ICON_BULLET]You may conscript one less citizen with a draft action in a city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is higher since you do all you can to meet the needs of your marginalized elements of society and the more communities you have, the more this becomes an issue.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Military Units take longer to train due to reluctance among the people to enlist.
	[ICON_BULLET]Periods of anger from whipping slaves for construction and training is much longer than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Enemy War Weariness is reduced since foes tend to think of your people as snowflakes.</English>

		<English>Positive Trait
"Human rights and dignities are the most important thing to expand upon and protect."
Far from a basket of deplorables, you and your people are engaged social activists and civil rights warriors. You do all you can to ensure fair treatment in this system and you benefit from some very unique and uncommon game effects in the process. However, it is heavily advised to never whip your slaves. Your people have no tolerance for mistreatment of anyone. Slavery itself is not particularly penalized because as long as you treat people well, it's understood to just be another station in society. War should be avoided if possible and as conscientious objectors, your people are reluctant to enter into military service. Your Leader also believes that all religions should be capable of tolerating one another and should be able to bring their own unique benefits to their diverse society without bias. The benefits in this trait are so unusual and potent that there are no Primary and Secondary Benefits here, just Benefits.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]The presence of any religion gives a base benefit in yields, commerce and happiness regardless of if they are your state religion or not.
	[ICON_BULLET]Golden Ages are far longer than normal here since people so greatly rejoice in the strength of their diversity.
	[ICON_BULLET]Cities require significantly less food to grow.
	[ICON_BULLET]You get a Free Specialist for each World Wonder in your city.
	[ICON_BULLET]You get a Free Specialist for each National Wonder in your city.
	[ICON_BULLET]You get a Free Specialist for each Team Project in your city.
	[ICON_BULLET]All religions are active in your nation on the Religious Disabling option.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities enjoy a reduction in Crime.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities enjoy a reduction in Disease.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities enjoy an increase in Education.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Basic Upkeep is more expensive. New progressive programs are consistently attempted and are often more costly than they prove beneficial.
	[ICON_BULLET]You may conscript fewer citizens with a draft action in a city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is significantly higher since you do all you can to meet the needs of your marginalized elements of society and the more communities you have, the more this becomes an issue.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Military Units take longer to train due to reluctance among the people to enlist.
	[ICON_BULLET]Periods of anger from whipping slaves for construction and training is doubled.

		<English>Positive Trait
"Our most sacred duty is to spread our people across the face of the Earth. Swell in numbers and we shall outperform all other competitors. Fertility and health are our greatest resources."
This trait gives your city a powerful head start in population and culture and then backs that up by making your cities require less food to grow and supports greater population with happiness benefits and faster unit training. However, it can cost you directly in gold expenses, which can already be a strain on fast growing nations, and make sure you aren't just placing these faster sprouting assets for others to easily capture.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a percentage modifier to Food and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Cities start with an additional population.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities are healthier because the people are inspired to nurture one another.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities all produce an extra base Food and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Cities require a bit less food to grow.
	[ICON_BULLET]Newly placed cities are given a small amount of immediate culture.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all penalized a base Gold.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities all suffer from a percentage reduction to Gold.
	[ICON_BULLET]Merchant and Noble type Specialists maintain enormous family clans themselves and thus end up costing you one Gold each.
	[ICON_BULLET]Hurrying construction and training through whipping is a travesty to population development and therefore your people hang on to anger for this for a long time.</English>

"Its too much effort to clean up and it gets in the way of progress to worry about it. Nature will sort it out eventually."
When your rivers run neon blue due to pollutants and air stations are installed for citizens to refill their tanks, you know you might have allowed a bit too much 'freedom' for the good of the world. But hey, you probably made a lot of money doing it so hopefully you're happy with what you've earned. Your people certainly aren't. They probably miss the trees and healthy grasslands that once produced so much food for them but now struggles to sprout weeds, let alone crops. Ok, it might not start off that bad, but hey... let's see just how many dunes we can spread across the Earth and still manage to survive as a species!
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from more Air Pollution.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from more Water Pollution.
Unique Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All your units gain the Slob I Promotion, which makes all your units leave garbage wherever they go, thus spreading an additional Air and Water pollution in their wake each round.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all more unhealthy.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all more unhappy.
	[ICON_BULLET]Artist Type Specialists cost a Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]Celebrity and Artist Type Specialists produce one less Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]You get a Diplomatic penalty since your waste tends to find and disturb the rest of the world.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Generic Upkeep is reduced since being irresponsible with industry is cheap.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain a small percentage modifier to Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is reduced.
	[ICON_BULLET]Corporations are cheaper to operate without emissions and waste regulations.
	[ICON_BULLET]The cost of upkeep for each Military Unit is reduced since you don't care to cover the labor costs of cleaning up after them.
	[ICON_BULLET]The expense of rushing constructions and training is reduced since your industries are skilled at cutting corners to get faster results.</English>

"Its too much effort to clean up and it gets in the way of progress to worry about it. Nature will sort it out eventually."
When your rivers run neon blue due to pollutants and air stations are installed for citizens to refill their tanks, you know you might have allowed a bit too much 'freedom' for the good of the world. But hey, you probably made a lot of money doing it so hopefully you're happy with what you've earned. Your people certainly aren't. They probably miss the trees and healthy grasslands that once produced so much food for them but now struggles to sprout weeds, let alone crops. Ok, it might not start off that bad, but hey... let's see just how many dunes we can spread across the Earth and still manage to survive as a species!
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All specialists cost an extra Food.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from significantly more Air Pollution.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from significantly more Water Pollution.
Unique Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All your units gain the Slob III Promotion, which makes all your units leave garbage wherever they go, thus spreading an additional Air and Water pollution in their wake each round.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all more unhealthy.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are all more unhappy.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Largest cities are much less Happy since these Urban communities are festering in garbage.
	[ICON_BULLET]You get a Diplomatic penalty since your waste tends to find and disturb the rest of the world.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Generic Upkeep is reduced since being irresponsible with industry is cheap.

	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is significantly reduced.

		<English>Positive Trait
"Delegation of command through intensive training is the way to superiority on the battlefield. When every soldier uses his head and heart to obtain mastery at his craft, we have a force that can win any conflict."
Discipline means everything for this leader and he demands it at every level of his highly organized nation. Competency is the prime directive he issues from his place of rule and although it does cost him in a number of ways, he finds the return in value very worthwhile.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Free Experience points to all units.
	[ICON_BULLET]Less Experience required for units to gain levels.
	[ICON_BULLET]Small percentage modifier of bonus experience points assigned to units trained in the capital.
Unique Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Get a Golden Age whenever a Great General is born to your nation.
	[ICON_BULLET]Get a free Great General whenever you advance an Era.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Enhancement to the rate of earning Great Military People.
	[ICON_BULLET]Further enhancement to the rate of earning Great Military People when experience accumulated towards that goal is earned within your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military Training Buildings are cheaper to build.
	[ICON_BULLET]Techs that bring military training benefits are faster to discover.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your units gain more experience when they fight inside your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]Slightly increased Defense against Espionage due to the improved level of discipline, and thus care taken with procedure, at every level of command.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Generals are a little more likely to be born as normal Great People.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Slightly reduced rate of earning standard Great People. The importance placed on discipline suppresses the creative genius in some individuals that may have otherwise become powerfully influential.
	[ICON_BULLET]Military units cost more to train due to the increased efforts and costs involved in training them to such a degree of enhanced excellence.
	[ICON_BULLET]Since Golden Ages are far more common, they last a quarter less rounds when they take place. People don't remain impressed with their society as long.
	[ICON_BULLET]More expensive to upgrade units since they are more specialized and have greater demands on their quality.</English>

"It requires careful, meticulous planning to run an empire and all these people wanting me to focus on all of these things need to just quiet down on their enthusiasm. I'll get to it all when I'm damned good and ready!"
This leader has his own way of doing things and puts importance on the most basic things taking place in his empire. He does not care to try to leave a huge legacy and is very patient when making his demands. People often resist doing what he wishes and go about those things with less exuberance, and the results show in the end. He more thoroughly trains his military and it makes them hard to improve with later developments.

"Me? Attack someone else? No... no... initiating a war is just too great a risk and morally wrong."
While this trait will hobble your nation in offensive war efforts, it does give you some defensive benefits and makes war less likely to be thrust upon you. If you can compensate in other ways, like outgrowing your opponents, you might be able to succeed despite this painful set of penalties.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Inflicts War Weariness upon enemy players slower than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Increased cost of upkeep per military unit.
Unique Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Applies the Timid I promotion to all Combatant and Naval Combatant units. Gives a large attack penalty but a small defense bonus.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Decrease in the rate of earning Great Military People.
	[ICON_BULLET]Combatants and Naval Combatants lose a few Experience points when trained.
	[ICON_BULLET]Combatants and Naval Combatants take longer to train. The people are culturally resistant to the idea of being in the military.
	[ICON_BULLET]You accumulate significantly more War Weariness than usual.
	[ICON_BULLET]Small decrease to the maximum number of population you convert to units during a Conscription action in a city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Lose some Free Military Units if you are getting some from other sources.
	[ICON_BULLET]Slightly less likely to capture enemy units when defeating them. Your troops often let surviving enemies flee.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units are more likely to be captured when defeated. Your units will more readily surrender to be taken alive.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Increase in the rate of earning Great Military People on combats that take place inside your borders. Enough to counter the penalty you get overall so that the penalty really ONLY applies when the battle is outside your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]Increase in the amount of experience earned during fights within your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]Slightly improved base city defense level.
	[ICON_BULLET]Bonus to diplomacy. It's very comforting to other leaders to believe it's unlikely you're going to ever attack them, or anyone else for that matter.
	[ICON_BULLET]Less expensive to upgrade units. Retraining simpler units that act more effectively at harnessing their terror than tapping into anger and hate is less costly.</English>
		<German>Negative Charaktereigenschaft
"Es gibt eine Grenze, wo Zurückhaltung aufhört, eine Tugend zu sein." - Edmund Burke (1729-1797)
Obwohl diese Charaktereigenschaft dir Steine bei eventuellen Kriegsbestrebungen in den Weg legt, bringt sie doch auch unbestreitbare defensive Vorteile und sorgt dafür, dass deine Nation wesentlich seltener in bewaffnete Auseinandersetzungen verwickelt wird. Wem es gelingt, die üblen Nachteile anderweitig zu kompensieren, etwa durch technologische Fortschritte oder kulturelle Ausbreitung, der kann durchaus auch als schüchterner Anführer siegreich sein.
Primäre Nachteile::
	[ICON_BULLET]verzögerte Kriegsmüdigkeit bei gegnerischen Nationen
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte laufende Kosten für militärische Einheiten
Einschränkungen für Einheiten:
	[ICON_BULLET]alle Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten erhalten automatisch die Beförderung Schüchtern I
Weitere Nachteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]gesenkte Geburtenrate für Große Feldherren
	[ICON_BULLET]Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten erhalten beim Training weniger Erfahrungspunkte
	[ICON_BULLET]verzögertes Training für Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten (Die Bevölkerung hat keine Erfahrung mit Auseinandersetzungen und ist dementsprechend untrainiert.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Steigerung der Kriegsmüdigkeit des eigenen Volkes
	[ICON_BULLET]Senkung der Anzahl an neuen Militäreinheiten, die über Einberufungsaktionen gewonnen werden können
	[ICON_BULLET]weniger freie Einheiten, für die keine laufenden Kosten anfallen
	[ICON_BULLET]geringere Wahrscheinlichkeit für die Gefangennahme gegnerischer Einheiten (Deine Truppen lassen überlebende Gegner eher entkommen.)
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte Wahrscheinlichkeit für die Gefangennahme eigener Einheiten (Deine Truppen hängen am Leben und ergeben sich eher.)
Vorteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]normale Geburtenrate für Große Feldherren bei Gefechten innerhalb der eigenen Grenzen (Der Bonus für Gefechte außerhalb der eigenen Grenzen wird gerade aufgehoben.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Erhöhung der Erfahrungspunkte für Gefechte innerhalb der eigenen Grenzen
	[ICON_BULLET]verbesserte Stadtverteidigung
	[ICON_BULLET]Vorteile bei diplomatischen Verhandlungen (Andere Staatsoberhäupter fühlen sich wohler, wenn sie nicht ständig mit Angriffen rechnen müssen.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Preissenkung für die Modernisierung von Einheiten (Da weniger Wert auf die neuesten Taktiken und Tötungsarten gelegt wird, werden Kosten gespart.)</German>

		<Russian>Negative Trait
'Me? Attack someone else? No initiating a war is just too great a risk and morally wrong.'
While this trait will hobble your nation in offensive war efforts, it does give you some defensive benefits and makes war less likely to be thrust upon you. If you can compensate in other ways, like outgrowing your opponents, you might be able to succeed despite this painful set of penalties.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Inflicts War Weariness upon enemy players much slower than normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]Increased cost of upkeep per military unit.
	[ICON_BULLET]You accumulate far more War Weariness than usual.
Unique Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Applies the Timid II promotion to all Combatant and Naval Combatant units. Gives a large attack penalty but a small defense bonus.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Decrease in the rate of earning Great Military People.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Military People city specialists lose two Gold each.
	[ICON_BULLET]Combatants and Naval Combatants lose Experience points when trained.
	[ICON_BULLET]Combatants and Naval Combatants take longer to train. The people are culturally resistant to the idea of being in the military.
	[ICON_BULLET]Decrease to the maximum number of population you convert to units during a Conscription action in a city.
	[ICON_BULLET]Lose some Free Military Units if you are getting some from other sources.
	[ICON_BULLET]Slightly less likely to capture enemy units when defeating them. Your troops often let surviving enemies flee.
	[ICON_BULLET]Units are more likely to be captured when defeated. Your units will more readily surrender to be taken alive.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Increase in the rate of earning Great Military People on combats that take place inside your borders. Enough to counter the penalty you get overall so that the penalty really ONLY applies when the battle is outside your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]Increase in the amount of experience earned during fights within your borders.
	[ICON_BULLET]Improved base city defense level.
	[ICON_BULLET]Bonus to diplomacy. It's very comforting to other leaders to believe it's unlikely you're going to ever attack them, or anyone else for that matter.
	[ICON_BULLET]Less expensive to upgrade units. Retraining simpler units that act more effectively at harnessing their terror than tapping into anger and hate is less costly.</Russian>

		<German>Negative Charaktereigenschaft
"Es gibt eine Grenze, wo Zurückhaltung aufhört, eine Tugend zu sein." - Edmund Burke (1729-1797)
Obwohl diese Charaktereigenschaft dir Steine bei eventuellen Kriegsbestrebungen in den Weg legt, bringt sie doch auch unbestreitbare defensive Vorteile und sorgt dafür, dass deine Nation wesentlich seltener in bewaffnete Auseinandersetzungen verwickelt wird. Wem es gelingt, die üblen Nachteile anderweitig zu kompensieren, etwa durch technologische Fortschritte oder kulturelle Ausbreitung, der kann durchaus auch als schüchterner Anführer siegreich sein.
Primäre Nachteile::
	[ICON_BULLET]verzögerte Kriegsmüdigkeit bei gegnerischen Nationen
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte laufende Kosten für militärische Einheiten
	[ICON_BULLET]Steigerung der Kriegsmüdigkeit des eigenen Volkes
Einschränkungen für Einheiten:
	[ICON_BULLET]alle Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten erhalten automatisch die Beförderung Schüchtern III
Weitere Nachteile:

"We already know everything we need to know! Stick to tradition or we'll lose our way!"
You might feel this is clearly the worst selection for all Negative Traits but it's actually been a historically common way to see things for people. Change can be frightening and discoveries bring change. There are some significant benefits to offset the obvious hindrance of researching slower, but you can also overcome your impediment in other ways, such as enhanced Commerce levels elsewhere, taking the scientific achievements from your conquered enemy cities, stealing technologies with espionage, or simply out-expanding your rivals. This is a fairly happy people that can be much more stable for you if you give them the reliability they desire.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities are penalized a couple less base Research.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a percentage penalty to Research.
	[ICON_BULLET]All Specialists cost a Research.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are less Healthy since the people tend to stoically deny any need for treatment, not trusting what they don't understand.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your nation generates Great People slower. Those with new ideas tend to suffer mockery and mistrust.
	[ICON_BULLET]Buildings that are focused on Science and Research are slower to build.
	[ICON_BULLET]Scientist type Specialists generate one less Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Citizen and Slave type Specialists cost a Research.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Capital generates a percentage less Research.
	[ICON_BULLET]Technologies that lead to developments in Science and Research are slower to discover.
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy time is increased since your people resent any changes.
	[ICON_BULLET]Religious Anarchy time is greatly increased since your people are stubbornly fixed in their ways.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Scientists are less likely to be born.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your largest cities are happier since urban living promises more reliable patterns day to day.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities gain an extra free specialist because the people obtain a higher degree of mastery through reliable routines.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are a bit easier to Educate since your people don't fear their knowledge being obsoleted by new discoveries.</English>

"Let the people get sick so they can figure out how not to. Besides, we can turn our diseased against our enemies who are weak in their sterile environments."
There can be an advantage to allowing disease to plague your nation without offering it much resistance. The people CAN end up stronger, those who survive the outbreaks anyhow. Generally speaking, it is not considered a great way to run things in a country, however, and it certainly leads to public resentment. It's certainly cheaper at least.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are significantly more Unhealthy.
	[ICON_BULLET]Disease is significantly increased in all cities.
Unique Abilities:
	[ICON_BULLET]Most stealthy unit types and animal units all gain the Unsanitary I Promotion, which causes the promoted units to spread the Disease Property.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are less Happy thanks to resent for the toll that frequent rampant disease takes on their lives and those of loved ones.
	[ICON_BULLET]Buildings that improve your capacity to combat Disease are slower to build.
	[ICON_BULLET]Citizen Type Specialists produce one less Production.
	[ICON_BULLET]Scientist and Doctor Type Specialists generate one less Research.

	[ICON_BULLET]Your Healer units are trained with one less Experience Point.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Healer units are trained slower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your nation suffers from more War Weariness since your people don't feel you have their best interests at heart.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Doctors are less likely to be born in your cities.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities require a little more food to grow thanks to a much higher mortality rate.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Generic Upkeep is cheaper since budgeting for medical care is of no governmental concern.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Distance to Capital is lower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Maintenance from Number of Cities is lower.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your people let go of anger tremendously faster from whip rushing construction and training since life has much less meaning in a sick society.</English>

"Let the people of the land rejoice! For I have liberated them from the weak leaders they relied upon before my arrival. The power of this position is now mine to wield and we have a lot more conquering ahead of us!"
This leader has taken command by force and the people resent him for bypassing due process and disposing of the original leadership. You may be able to enjoy some very strong military benefits, but if you select this trait, do ALL you can to avoid running out of specialist slots and land to work because citizens will cost you far more than they generate thanks to the will to undermine and rebel that exists among those who don't have much to lose to oppose you. Better to keep your population whipped down to a manageable size, or at least openly angry and unhappy than pretending to do you any favors.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities suffer a percentage penalty to Gold and Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]Citizen Type Specialists cost a Production.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities are less happy, resentful of the way your leader took power.
	[ICON_BULLET]National Wonders are slower to construct due to a complete lack of national pride.
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolutions option, your cities are less stable and more likely to revolt.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities lose a base Gold and Culture.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Capital suffers a percentage penalty to Food, Production and Commerce.
	[ICON_BULLET]Your Capital suffers a percentage penalty to Gold and Culture.

	[ICON_BULLET]Your cities suffer from a bit more Crime since many citizens wish to foment revolt against you.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]General Upkeep is reduced due to the elimination of a lot of government staff.
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Military People emerge significantly faster in this nation since your leader came to power relying on some key military figures.
	[ICON_BULLET]Civic Anarchy time is greatly reduced since resistance to policy changes is met with the punishment of death.</English>

		<English>Positive Trait
"War is the way of the world. Only by being stronger than all others can we obtain peace."
This leader is intensely focused on the efficient and effective training of the basics of warfare and promotes a martial culture throughout his empire.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Free Military units from a bonus earned by the total amount of your overall population.
	[ICON_BULLET]Greatly improved speed of training all Military units.
	[ICON_BULLET]Strong Reduction in the price of upgrading your units.
Unique Abilities:
	[ICON_BULLET]Free Combat I Promotion to all Combatant units. While Combat I is a fairly basic promotion with a relatively minor +10% combat modifier, it is a major prerequisite for other promotions and therefore places your units closer to more specialized abilities.
	[ICON_BULLET]All cities will use food as production when units are being trained. This reduces the growth rate in those cities significantly, but also increases the speed you produce your units and helps you take advantage of highly food producing regions for military preparedness.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Increased rate of earning Great Military People.
	[ICON_BULLET]Reduction in War Weariness you suffer. Your people embrace the idea that war will help them achieve their aims personally.
	[ICON_BULLET]Small improvement to the maximum number of population you convert to units during a Conscription action in a city.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Increased Upkeep from the costs of providing the programs your nation needs to obtain these benefits.
	[ICON_BULLET]Moderate Education penalty. The people are more focused on developing personal prowess than on studies.
	[ICON_BULLET]Minor Health Penalty. The fascination with combat and fighting increases rates of injury and mortality.</English>
		<German>Positive Charaktereigenschaft
"Je stärker wir sind, desto unwahrscheinlicher ist der Krieg." - Otto von Bismarck (1815 - 1898)
Dieser Anführer ist nur auf den Ausbau und das Training seines Militärs fokussiert. Sein martialischer Führungsstil sorgt dafür, dass in der ganzen Gesellschaft Kampf und Auseinandersetzungen im Vordergrund stehen.
Primäre Vorteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]Erhöhung der freien Militäreinheiten basierend auf der Gesamtbevölkerung
	[ICON_BULLET]beschleunigte Ausbildung von Militäreinheiten
	[ICON_BULLET]Preissenkung für die Modernisierung von Einheiten
Vorteile für Einheiten:
	[ICON_BULLET]alle Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten erhalten automatisch die Beförderung Rang I - Leutnant
	[ICON_BULLET]alle Städte nutzen [ICON_FOOD] als [ICON_PRODUCTION], wenn Einheiten ausgebildet werden (beschleunigte Einheitenproduktion zum Preis eines stark verlangsamten Stadtwachstums)
Weitere Vorteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte Geburtenrate für Große Feldherren
	[ICON_BULLET]Verminderung der Kriegsmüdigkeit des eigenen Volkes (Die Bevölkerung empfindet den Krieg als beste Variante, um die eigenen Ziele zu erreichen.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Erhöhung der Anzahl an neuen Militäreinheiten, die über Einberufungsaktionen gewonnen werden können
Nachteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte laufende Kosten für die Gesellschaft
	[ICON_BULLET]verminderter Bildungsstand (Das Volk konzentriert sich mehr auf Körperertüchtigung und Kampf als auf das Lernen und Forschen.)
	[ICON_BULLET]verminderte Gesundheit (Die Kampfeslust führt zu häufigeren Verletzungen und einer höheren Sterblichkeit.)</German>

"War is the way of the world. Only by being stronger than all others can we obtain peace."
This leader is intensely focused on the efficient and effective training of the basics of warfare and promotes a martial culture throughout his empire.
Primary Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Huge Reduction in War Weariness you suffer. Your people embrace the idea that war will help them achieve their aims personally.
	[ICON_BULLET]Free Military units from a bonus earned by the total amount of your overall population.
	[ICON_BULLET]Strong improvement to the speed of training all Military units.
	[ICON_BULLET]Strong Reduction in the price of upgrading your units.
Unique Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Free Combat II Promotion to all Combatant units. While Combat II is a fairly basic promotion with a relatively minor +10% combat modifier, it is a major prerequisite for other promotions and therefore places your units closer to more specialized abilities.
Side Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Increased rate of earning Great Military People.
	[ICON_BULLET]Moderate improvement to the maximum number of population you convert to units during a Conscription action in a city.
Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]Increased Upkeep from the costs of providing the programs your nation needs to obtain these benefits.
	[ICON_BULLET]Moderate Education penalty. The people are more focused on developing personal prowess than on studies.
	[ICON_BULLET]Minor Health Penalty. The fascination with combat and fighting increases rates of injury and mortality.
	[ICON_BULLET]Minor Happiness Penalty. The competitiveness and high value placed on martial superiority leaves many feeling marginalized and suppressed.</English>
		<German>Positive Charaktereigenschaft
"Je stärker wir sind, desto unwahrscheinlicher ist der Krieg." - Otto von Bismarck (1815 - 1898)
Dieser Anführer ist nur auf den Ausbau und das Training seines Militärs fokussiert. Sein martialischer Führungsstil sorgt dafür, dass in der ganzen Gesellschaft Kampf und Auseinandersetzungen im Vordergrund stehen.
Primäre Vorteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]Verminderung der Kriegsmüdigkeit des eigenen Volkes (Die Bevölkerung empfindet den Krieg als beste Variante, um die eigenen Ziele zu erreichen.)
	[ICON_BULLET]Erhöhung der freien Militäreinheiten basierend auf der Gesamtbevölkerung
	[ICON_BULLET]beschleunigte Ausbildung von Militäreinheiten
	[ICON_BULLET]Preissenkung für die Modernisierung von Einheiten
Vorteile für Einheiten:
	[ICON_BULLET]alle Kämpfer- und Marineeinheiten erhalten automatisch die Beförderung Rang II - Oberleutnant
Weitere Vorteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte Geburtenrate für Große Feldherren
	[ICON_BULLET]Erhöhung der Anzahl an neuen Militäreinheiten, die über Einberufungsaktionen gewonnen werden können
Nachteile:
	[ICON_BULLET]erhöhte laufende Kosten für die Gesellschaft
	[ICON_BULLET]verminderter Bildungsstand (Das Volk konzentriert sich mehr auf Körperertüchtigung und Kampf als auf das Lernen und Forschen.)
	[ICON_BULLET]verminderte Gesundheit (Die Kampfeslust führt zu häufigeren Verletzungen und einer höheren Sterblichkeit.)
	[ICON_BULLET]verminderte Zufriedenheit (Da in der Gesellschaft die körperlich Überlegenen besser angesehen sind und ein starker Wettbewerb herrscht, fühlen sich viele Bürger ausgegrenzt und unterdrückt.)</German>

		<English>Negative Trait
"Our gods are the ONLY gods and those who believe otherwise have earned their wrath and deserve to die!"
This leader takes his faith to a dramatically unhealthy level of devotion. He likely suffers from cognitive dissonance as he uses his faith to justify all manner of violence and hatred, even though his faith may at its core promote peace and harmony. His people live in fear that if they are not devout, they will run afoul of harsh laws and penalties. But they live in even greater fear of the extremely demanding role they can fall into as religious leaders.
Primary Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]The anarchy time to change religions is twice as long as normal.
	[ICON_BULLET]For every non-state religion in a city, you suffer from an additional unhappiness.
	[ICON_BULLET]Gain a penalty to diplomacy since other leaders fear, and find irritating, your desire to force your religious views on others.
	[ICON_BULLET]Lose a percentage amount of free experience on units trained in Holy Cities of non-state religions.
	[ICON_BULLET]When playing with the Religious Disabling option, all Non-State Religions are inactive, and, depending on civics, if they also bar Non-State Religions, their buildings are destroyed rather than simply disabled.
Abilities:
	[ICON_BULLET]All combat capable units gain the Devotion I promotion, which gives a strong religious combat modifier, which is a combat modifier that applies as a benefit to your unit if the opponent unit is not of your religion, but as a penalty if they are.
Side Penalties:
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolutions Option, cities are less stable with multiple religions present.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest type City Specialists lose one Food yield.
	[ICON_BULLET]A small overall Gold percent penalty in all cities. Even the government donates a percentage to the Church.
	[ICON_BULLET]Priest type City Specialists give an additional Gold and Research.
	[ICON_BULLET]Religious and Spiritual technologies are discovered slower. The people are terrified of new religious thought.
	[ICON_BULLET]Non-state religions are significantly more difficult to spread.
Benefits:
	[ICON_BULLET]Great Military People are generated a little faster since those with great fervor for the religion are heavily motivated to serve.
	[ICON_BULLET]On the Revolutions Option, cities are more stable with your religion.
	[ICON_BULLET]Wherever you have spread your State Religion, you produce Great People faster.
	[ICON_BULLET]Allows the nation to produce Inquisitor units once technologically unlocked, that can remove all religions but the state religion in a city.</English>
