<!-- Tech Diffusion: Plain BTS includes an adjustment to research rate based on how many civs you have met which already know a tech.
     Tech Diffusion modifies this to take into account relationships, so tech diffuses fastest through open borders.
     In addition, it enables a kind of tech welfare to keep the civs who are far behind technologically relevant. -->
