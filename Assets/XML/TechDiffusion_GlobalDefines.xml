<!-- Tech Diffusion: Plain BTS includes an adjustment to research rate based on how many civs you have met which already know a tech.
     Tech Diffusion modifies this to take into account relationships, so tech diffuses fastest through open borders.
     In addition, it enables a kind of tech welfare to keep the civs who are far behind technologically relevant. -->

		<!-- Tech Diffusion: Power of research rate increase based on number of teams you know who already know the tech you're researching.
			 This is a additive percent value; 100 means doubling tech at maximum magnitude, 25 means adding 25%, etc.
			 Maximum magnitude" means you've met every single civ, have open borders with all, and they all have the tech. -->

		<!-- Tech Diffusion: Welfare threshold determines how far above a players tech the diffuser has to be, before the maximum welfare modifier
			 applies to modifiy their tech diffusion value.
			 Ex: If my most expensive tech is 10 beakers, their most expensive is 11, and TDWelfareThresh is 20, that means they're only 10% better
			 than us instead of 20%, so the WelfareModifier is halved; we only get 2.5x more TD *from them* instead of 5x (for a 5 TD Welfare Modifer).
			 In essence, this and Welfare Modifier control how hard TD pushes when a player is close to the leader(s) vs when far from them.
			 Note that negative percents apply immediately, however! If you're above someone - say 10 to their 9 - you get the full 5x reduction. -->
