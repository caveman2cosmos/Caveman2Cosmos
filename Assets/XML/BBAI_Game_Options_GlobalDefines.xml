		<!-- Better BTS AI: Changes behavior of defensive pacts (Def: 0) :
			0 : Default BETTER BTS: If a member of a pact DOWS, only they loose their pact(s) and only they are at war.
					Other pacts agreements between non-aggressive members remain intact. If however an external aggressor attacks a pact,
					the directly involved members of the pact retaliate with war but their pact is cancelled and must renegotiated.
					Note that all other uninvolved pacts that were in place between the retaliating parties, are cancelled at that time as well.
			1 : Defensive pacts are multi-party capable pacts that do not cancel when a pact member is DOWED on and all members DOW on the aggressor.  However if a particular aggressor in the pact DOWs, he looses his defense pact and only that member is at war. All other aggreements in the defense party remain intact.
			2 : Offensive pacts: Defensive pacts do not cancel when a pact member is DOWED on, and do not cancel if any pact member DOWS either (multi-party offensive and defensive pacts)

		<!-- Fuyu: Changes behavior of unit capturing for AI players (Def: 1) :
			0 : Default BTS: Workers are mostly destroyed if an AI player captures them.
			1 : Workers are only destroyed if an AI player captures them from a human player,
				only rare worker destruction in AI vs AI wars.
			2 : AI always captures workers, never kills them.
