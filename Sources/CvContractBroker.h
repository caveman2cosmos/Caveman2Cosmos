//
//	The CvContractBroker abstracts a communication that allows 'idle' units to advertise themselves
//	as 'looking for work', and for requests for units to be placed with priority and criteria.  This
//	allows for cooperative behavior without both parties needing to be fully aware of the logic, and
//	reduces the need for searching when a unit looks for the best activity to undertake, which helps
//	performance
//
//	Intended usage is in a 2-pass process (from CvUnitAI::AI_update()).  In the unit's activity choice AI
//	it should:
//		1)	If it has high priority work determined directly by its own unit AI push that mission
//		2)	If no high priority work advertise itself with this broker as available for work and return
//			from AI_update() with no mission pushed (which measn it'll get called again once all the units
//			have been cycled through)
//		3)	On the second call ask for the best work from this broker and if provided push a mission
//			to do what is asked of it (move to a location, join a group being current options)
//		4)	If no suitable work is available continue with its own unit AI for low priority actions
